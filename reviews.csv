"Beautiful acting, beautiful directing, not so great story
I had to open an account just to review this movie. The acting in this was of the hook. There is some serious talent shown. It was beautiful to look at too. I however was disappointed by the story line. By the end of the movie I didn't feel the title ""King of boys"" was justified. The running time was also too long. That said, I love the cast and cinematography...the costumes and music.....the blend of languages and realistic depiction of our country (Nigeria). This is a beautiful work of art.",positive
"Good movie, would love to see a continuation of this movie.",positive
"One thing I like about the movie is the way the story was told and the ways the actors interpreted it. The writers, directors and cinematographers deserve an applaud for this effort. But she should have cut off some unnecessary scenes including music performances. Good movie export for Nollywood. Got to admit the best I have seen so far in years. My star rating is for Nollywood not international. Thanks",positive
"If you enjoyed the Godfather then you'll enjoy this. The storyline was beautiful and the plot twist at the end was incredible but there was some very unrealistic scenes that prove to be plot holes. SPOILER ALERT. The shooter of Eniola's daughter had his hand high in the air only for the bullet to hit her stomach. The phrase which the police chief had used when dropping the bribe is not one someone would repeat unconsciously. And finally the fire at the prison only showed outside when the officer entered the prison there was no fire in sight neither was the place hot. By all logic Eniola was supposed to die in that prison due to suffocation but she miraculously was unharmed, the prison bars didn't even get heated. But all in all the plot is very solid.",positive
"On a Nollywood scale I'll give this movie an 9 because of it's unique storyline and excellent production which sets it aside from other Nigerian movies but just like other Nigerian movies it was excessively long and had extras who didn't know their roles, some part of the movie was unrealistic eg. the fire on the cell part but that's not the issue, the issue is this; as i was watching the movie I couldn't help but feel nostalgic, after a few minutes of brainstorming I remembered where i had seen the movie before if you can't remember I'll remind you, it's Al Pacino meets Francis Ford, yes The Godfather II to be precise. My original rating was an 8 but because of it's lack of originality i give it a 4 on a world scale and 9 on Nollywood scale. If other Nigerian directors can learn from this and just remake Hollywood classics the Nigerian cinema would be a better place.",positive
"An imporvement on most Nigerian Movies, but not perfect
This movie was recomendd to me by my wife. it's a good overal production with some very good acting and production design. Eni Salami is a chracter that sticks with you long after the movie has finished. My main complaint with the movie is the lack of competent editing. Easily 30 mins could have been cut out. There was lots of over drawn out dialog and scenes that basically did not need to be included. In summary a good movie, one of the better Nigerian productions, but could have been much better, with some improved post produciton work",positive

"Still one of the Best Nigerian films of 2017
Isoken is a great film showcasing the culture of the area of the country. The layout, filming, colors and dressing tell much of the tradition quite well. The film has quite a good inject of laughter and great acting (Isoken, her mother, black boyfriend). However, like most Nigerian films, it becomes too predictable and by halfway, you can guess the end. which is usually a Cinderella ending. the last 10 minutes do the most harm to the film: flying out the next day and the whole family rushing out to meet the new bf at a party ??. Not in nature of the culture around here.

The film is a worthy film of Nigeria and great to learn some of the culture. Especially about weddings and how they are planned. Great work. Expect a better 2nd part someday",positive

Hardly was there a period of 5 minute in this movie with nothing to smile, chuckle or laugh about. I don't think there is a Nigerian movie that beats this in it's genre (Fictional Comedy). The movie effects were as well commendable.",positive
"Honest review from European Woman with Netflix subscription
I couldn't understand the low rating and the very high reviews some people stated where unrealistic or even paid to write. Since the movie popped up on my Netflix home screen I decided to give it a go and write an honest unpaid review. And this is just my opinion. I am a woman from Europe, an entirely different culture than the African one, but since this is a movie, and I watched it, I am entitled to my opinion! At first I was skeptical and I couldn't figure out what to think of it the first 30 minutes. But the acting was fine, I totally and absolutely loved the chemistry between the strong female lead and her uncle. What a character! This wasn't a heavy, dramatic movie, more a light hearted fast paced flick with a lot of elements that are almost comical. Hallmark like camera and music and I liked the directing and camera. The only thing I wasn't really happy about was that the movie quite suddenly was over. It could have used like ten minutes more of even a bit longer to work things out with the possible love interest. Conclusion: I liked it, I enjoyed myself, it was not a master piece, but a nice watch. Well done.",positive

"Very good, if not wholly fulfilling

It's unfortunate that 'The figurine' hasn't gotten a great deal of attention outside of Nigeria, as it's a worthy view - a drama and thriller, with supernatural elements, that keeps us watching from start to finish.

The film follows two friends, just setting out in life, who find an abandoned shrine and a totem inside that local legend says will grant seven years of good fortune. The catch is that legend says seven years of bad luck will follow.

I stumbled onto 'The figurine' while searching for something else, totally unaware of the accolades and high regard this film has garnered in Nigeria and beyond. That I'd never heard of it otherwise speaks to the rank politics of cinema in the US, where any feature produced outside North America or the United Kingdom is blandly pigeonholed as an ""international feature"" and barely gets any press, let alone release. As is often the case, this movie deserves more broad consideration.

This is more of a character study than anything else. There is drama, and suspense, and a mild sense of unease pervades the latter half of the film as tension ramps up. The cast all perform very well in their roles to bring the screenplay to life. Despite the prominence in the narrative of the noted figurine, the real focus is on the tangled webs of the relationships and interactions between characters. And it's very engaging, especially leading into the climax.

There are no specific faults that come to mind, yet personally I just find that 'The figurine' doesn't entirely connect. I can't put my finger on it, but I was somehow expecting something more. It's very enjoyable, but despite the tension and suspense in the story, it ultimately also feels understated at the finale, like something is missing. Maybe that's just me, though; in any case, putting aside that minor misgiving, I've no detractions to make.

Even a cursory glance at material about the making of 'The figurine' illustrates the hard work that went into producing the film, and I'm pleased to say it all paid off. Cinema industries all around the world deserve more attention from viewers, and we should endeavor to expand our purview - and 'The figurine' shows that there's a wealth of good movies to discover in Nollywood.",positive

"Not my type of movie but my type of actors

Remember to see the end of the review I got to know about this movie when my very good friend told me about it and the actors and I was like what? How can Chiwetel Ejiofor act in a Nigeria based movie,I know the movie has to do with UK and stuff but it was mainly in Nigeria. I know he's a Nigerian but,well I guess he gets paid to act,let's get back to the movie. The movie's talking about what a tribe in Nigeria did in the past just to gain independence and become a republic and how a man and his wife suffered from it and some other stuff going on in their life. I don't really watch Nigerian movies because I have got lot of hate for the country and his people but I wanted to watch this movie BC Chiwetel Ejiofor was in it. The one thing I didn't get is why the hell would you budget N1.60billion on a Nigeria movie that's rubbish,but you got top actors in it tho but it still ain't worth it. Its a really really nice movie for Nigerians and some others not just my type of movie. Its getting a 5+2 for Chiwetel Ejiofor being in it. Must watch Well if you don't agree with my review or you got any arguments",positive
"Sister Bond

Unlike some of my friends, I had not read the book prior to seeing the movie. In a Facebook discussion, Half of a Yellow Sun got excellent reviews on both the book and the movie, so I decided to check the movie out. I deeply appreciated seeing a movie with an emotional bond between two sisters who were connected in so many ways, but disconnected by romance and political views. Perhaps more intriguing were the circumstances that tore them apart, brought them together again. The movie actors were superb and each character was perfectly cast for their roles. I only wish movies like this would reach more people. It tells a story that is and was real about power, war and political unrest in Africa. I plan on reading the book as well.",positive
"Beautiful production but a weak storyline

The only reason I'm not going to give this a 10 out of 10 star review is because I found the story lacking. Many of the major characters weren't fully explored and were therefore wasted, and some of the plot twists made absolutely no sense. That aside, this series is an exquisite work of art. Everything from the cast to the music was perfect. You couldn't ask for a better actors, or ask for more beautiful locations. The scenery is a marvel to behold. The wardrobe mouth watering. The acting was superb.... Charley Boy is a delight to watch on camera. This was a wonderful effort by Kemi Adetiba and I'm really happy I got a chance to watch this. Looking forward to more and I'm sure the stories will improve.",positive
"A Good One
Hmmm... This was a movie. A GOOD ONE and that's about it. Buh let's break it down a bit.

Plot Kemi is still one of the best story tellers of all time in Nigeria. She has shown that time and again. From her music videos to movies. She knows how to tell and finish a story. She puts you at the edge of your sit in suspence and drops your jaw with a finish. Only this time she dragged on too much. It was unnecessarily longer than the movie should have been. I mean she spent the first episode rightfully introducing the queen and wasted too much time showing pain from the lead.

That was too much in my opinion. 8/10

Acting Man.... I think she focused more on the lead characters than she did for the rest. It's a body of work. I believe d energy should flow around all. The add-ons had bad or unnecessary script lines. The lead guard was too stiff the second in command was better. Needless to say the leads were magnificent. Jaw dropping performance. Second time Toni tones is giving me chills down my spine. Hot damn 8/10

SFX Special effects needed a lot more. I've seen much better in Nigerian movie. It's big budget movie I expected more. 5/10

Direction Kemi wrote and directed that means she brought her imagination to people's minds and they loved it. I applaud her. Buh like I said the acting was focused on some key moments and leads. Some parts lacked emotion and Its unfortunate cause Kemi always has scenes that give goosebumps. The scene in the beginning for instance thats EPIC what a way to begin. The best emotional scene in the movie in my opinion was the reporters argument with his wife in his apartment. Then the graveyard scene in the first episode was Iconic. I think she dwelled too much on it but still, literal goosebumps. 7/10

Script Although better than most Nigerian movies, needed more work. Some lines were better left unsaid. Especially the add-ons like the elders. They needed to be scene not heard. 7/10

Cast Mad choice of team but not totally on point. They came with their A game. Charlie Boy over acted his role though. Making him fake. At a point he was counting his words. He wasn't as natural as the rest. For a supporting role with a very important role to play, he didn't do justice to it. Sank the movie for me. I think Kemi was going with bad and dangerous but sexy something like Jafar in Aladdin or Rasputin Anastasia or Scar in Lion King. Bad buh like-able. Charlie boy was a No no. 7/10

Soundtrack An important part of every movie. This movie lacked a lot of that and audio effects in core areas were missing. 5/10

I like the fact that she never focuses on one Ethnic group. She mixed it all. Love that. Like I said it was a GOOD movie.",positive
"Good for a first.

A Naija Christmas As with almost any new high budget Nigerian movie, it aims for comedic relief and heavily lies in tropes. A fairly straightforward plot that delivers nothing new, save being the first Nigerian Christmas themed movie. Because of the heavy reliance on comedic elements, the plot isn't allowed to develop to have darker moments as such moments were snuffed out (a little letdown.) The casting was sweet. Seeing many familiar faces from YouTube series getting a shot into the spotlight was thrilling! (Segilola ogidan, Ade laoye & Abayomi Alvin.) Mercy Johnson finally gets a new nollywood movie where she can shine appropriately (Seven and a half dates & the ghost and the tout too, she can finally be forgiven for those travesties.)",positive
"Funny Christmas Comedy

This movie had me cracking up from the start. It's about 3 single brothers who are disappointing their mother because they haven't yet gotten married / have no kids. The brothers all have different reasons why they're still bachelors and it's a funny movie. I absolutely love Nigerian culture. 7/10.",positive
"Originally Unoriginal

The story has a lovely premise.

But if you're gonna tell a Nigerian story, at least tell it in a Nigerian way.

I couldn't help but notice the undertones of Western culture (and yes, a lot of Nigerian modern lifestyle is influenced by the West,) but to go so far as even patterning the dialogue after Western culture, that's too far.

The breakups and the relationship dynamics broke my last straw.

I love this movie, but as an ardent observer of Western cinema, it feels like a copy.

Whether it is a Nigerian copy of a Western story, or a Western copy of a Nigerian story, sometimes I just can't tell.",positive

"A good sequel but a remake would have been far better for good story buildup

I must say I commend the director and his acting too ( Ramsey Nouah).. but the xave been appreciated if started from the beginning (remake of the first movie in 1992) then later this... but I guess the actors like Kanayo, Okonkwo etc May not cut out the first act nor the sequel and they needed to make sure they are featured in the movie anyways.",positive

"Captures the quintessence of the horrid issue

More than 11% of all level students experience rape or sexual assault! Only 20% of female students report such incident to authorities. Even though 2/3rd of college students experience sexual harassment in campus, 89% of colleges report no such incident on campuses. (Source: American Association of University Women) And the data in a country like Nigeria is quite appalling! ""The majority (69.8%) of the respondents had been sexually harassed, with the main perpetrators being male classmates and lecturers. And requests to do something sexual in exchange for academic favors is 32.2%."" (Source: National Library of Medicine) The story contextualizes this horrid issue. It is based on the true events. Good cinematography esp few sceneries from Cape Verde and Senegal... .However, shorter runtime could have made this movie crispier. Also, the script writing lacks subtleness with somewhat middle-of-the-road dialogues. But it is still a MUST watch movie as it still captures the quintessence of the issue and delivers a clear message.",positive
"OK but WAY TOO LONG

I quite agree with what many others have said here about this movie. It tells an important story (based on a true one evidently) but the movie is WAY TOO LONG at two and a half hours and the ""acting"" is not really convincing at all. The acting in particular from the Gloria character was just dreadful. Every scene she played involved eye-rolling that was way over the top and quite unnecessary. I live in Thailand where Thai TV programs and movies are also way over acted which led me to believe that ""Gloria"" had probably done her acting training in Thailand rather than in West Africa.

This story really could have been very adequately told in 90 minutes. The extra hour just made it somewhat annoying. All the same, it was a decent movie and I rate it 7.0

"Fresh POV
It is not the kind of cinema we are used to in the western hemisphere, but the production highlights not only a story to develop, but also the colors and culture of the region in which it takes place.

Great story line. Sex offenders, sex addition Depict( the roots of addiction, what could have caused it and the life time effects it has on people and lives. Very touching.

It bothered me a lot of Izu's behavior, I could imagine the seriousness of his wife's actions for such ignorance, but yes, the reason was strong, as if there was a justification for rudeness and violence (even if the violence does not actually come to light, and stay in the verbal scope), the film has a gospel, talks about forgiveness and our actions, I really liked this simple Nigerian...

"
A great children movie

I think the Mirror Boy is a great children movie, simple in spirit, yet powerful, effective and well performed. It may seem almost nothing takes place in the adventure, but the spiritual concepts developed throughout are interesting and deep. It's truly a journey of initiation into the culture of the ancestors.

The soundtrack is awesome, varied and rich, quite appealing and also bridging tradition and contemporary concepts! For me the best performance is from Osita Iheme as the Mirror Boy.

This was my introduction to Nollywood cinema and I loved it. Will be looking for more Nigerian movies.",positive
"Scattershot but still packing some impacts

Being the directing and/or screenwriting debut of a well-known actor always loads a movie with a lot of baggage and expectations, for every critical darling like ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""Gone Baby Gone"" you get a forgettable ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" or ""D√©ficit"". The baggage only gets heavier when it also happens to be openly based on the actor's own life story. The last such case of this double-duty debut I can think of lead to the multi-award winning and nominated ""Lady Bird"" by Greta Gerwig, so... no pressure.

""Farming"" is British actor Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's telling of his own life story having been ""farmed out"" as a baby in the late 1960s to a couple in Tilbury. This was a common practice with African, mostly Nigerian, couples in the UK, where they would hire white, British foster parents to care for their children in the hope that it would lead to better lives for them. Many of these white families were working-class, not indifferent to the pay involved in fostering and unprepared for the unique challenges that the race relations of the practice could lead to. Adewale's film avatar Enitan is also farmed out, taken back for a few years by his biological parents to their native Nigeria, has constant identity crises after his return to England and these result in him joining a white supremacist skinhead gang.

As a testament to its staying cultural impact, Dave Chappelle's ""Black Klansman"" character is probably the first thing that comes to mind when picturing a black person joining a white supremacist group, but the situation is not even remotely played for laughs here. For the most part, ""Farming"" is brutal, Enitan's crisis and isolation, strong enough to make him want to join any group that'll take him even if it's just to hate on him, is greatly portrayed in all its troubling phases by Damson Idris (the actor playing him as a child, along with the rest of the child performers are unfortunately a lot less successful). Damson is not alone in carrying the movie, his strongest peer being an electrifying John Dagleish, playing the skinhead gang's leader with such power that one could understand Eni's wish to follow him, even through the obvious hate. Keeping the film from becoming monotonously bleak is an incredibly stylish production design (even if some locations are clearly too modern for their time setting) and the occasional gorgeous, almost classic, grainy stock, high-contrast photography coupled with a great selection of songs related to the Black British experience.

Among the rest of the cast, Kate Beckinsale is to be noted as she's never before been seen playing a character like this toxic-yet-watchable mother, and she does it well, it's just a shame that the character itself is almost a stock one in modern drama thanks to ""Tonya"", ""The Fighter"" and the already-mentioned ""Lady Bird"". AAA playing the avatar of his own father is interesting too, for the role this might have in his own process of dealing with the events depicted.

For all its audiovisual strengths the movie unfortunately falls short on the story department specially near the end. In an attempt to make the previous brutality end in less of a downer note, the final minutes try to wrap everything up a tad too nicely. This along with some unsure pacing decisions denote the nature of this movie as an opera prima, fortunately not to the extent of detracting from the end result though. Finally, considering the U.S.'s role as the leading cultural force in the world, where most of the art related to the race relations of black people originates from, it is refreshing to see a different aspect of these as they happen in other countries, specially when they're told so vividly by creatives who've lived through and been inspired by them.",positive

The subtitles were delayed a few seconds making some parts hard to follow and reducing the overall quality of the film. The microphones were also poorly operated.

"Soapy entertainment

I've never before seen a Nollywood film, so I was intrigued as to what director Biyi Bandele's 'Fifty' would be like. As it turns out, it was pretty much an African version of 'Dynasty'!

The film is about four affluent Lagos women who are 'of a certain age'. There's Elizabeth, a celebrity obstetrician whose taste in young men has led her daughter to disown her; Kate, a party planner becoming increasingly influenced by religion; Maria, a high-flying construction executive who discovers she is pregnant; and Tola, a reality television star with a dark family secret. Their story lines join, separate and join again before resolving themselves in best TV movie fashion.

It's not challenging at all, but certainly diverting and entertaining. Although all four lead actresses get their turns to emote, only Nse Ikpe-Etim, as Kate, has a consistently challenging role as the reason for her character's turn to religion is revealed. Bandele makes full use of Lagos' skyline with sweeping establishing shots over the city, although by the end of the film you may feel you've seen quite enough of the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge, as attractive a piece of engineering as it is.",positive

While waiting in a bar for a boat to cross a river, a man tells the story of Jav√©, a small town in the country of Bahia doomed to be submerged by the waters of a hydroelectric dam. When the illiterate dwellers of Jav√© find that their village will be flooded, they decide to ""scientifically"" document the story of Jav√© to show the historical importance of the place and present motives to stop the construction of the hydroelectric. However, only the former postman and persona non-grata Ant√¥nio Bi√° (Jos√© Dumont), who used the intimacy of the villagers to save his job in the post office, can write, but the population assigns him to register in a book the report of the remembrances of the storytellers.

""Narradores de Jav√©"" is a funny and dramatic simple story supported by a good and original screenplay, great direction and excellent performances of the cast formed by actors, actresses and amateurish simple persons. This low-budget movie presents a great political final speech of Antonio Bi√°, in one of the best moments of this little gem, when he shows the lack of importance of them to the powerful.",positive

beauty in simplicity
Emerenciano13 November 2006
Once more we can find art in the simplest of ordinary things. As days go by I am more convinced that we don't really need to look for vary elaborated films (nothing against them, of course) to see beauty and value. European and Brazilian cinema are live evidences of this thought. There many films which may be cited as great examples (many of them I have written about here in IMDb) of this.

""Narradores de Jav√©"", a generally hidden treasure even here in Brazil, is a very good Brazilian film with a simple, but good story. In a small village called Jav√©, the inhabitants are told to leave their home once the government plans to built a hydroelectric dam in the place. In despair, the population decides to write a document where all the values and traditions of the place would be together and thus stop the construction of the dam. The problem is, nobody in the village is able to write such paper. The solution is to invite Ant√¥nio Bi√°, a former inhabitant of the city, to do the job. Ant√¥nio then starts interviewing the people in the city and hears all the stories they have to tell. He has to decide what is true, legend or just a lie. The interviews happen among discussions, arguments and even physical fights. Many funny situations arise, specially for Brazilian who can enjoy the local accent and jokes. International audience, can have a very good time too, once the acting is superb and the scenery is beautiful.",positive
"A story told like no other
Sharon Ooja (Oloture) brings her expert acting skills into this one, alongside supporting actress Omowunmi Dada (Linda) who also did a great job.

Here, the director Kenneth Gyang doesn't care about personal feelings, but goes straight to give us a raw and unblemished look into this brutal ordeal on human trafficking, while still leaving room for lots of emotions. Pure art and a good premise, as most movies should be. The summary is these things happen and even if it sucks, that's how life is, this film shows us just that! My ratings may seem harsh, because I found some terrible plot holes, which would be spoiling it if I discussed them, but I think by international standards, the rating is fine. It's a quality movie, watch it with an open mind.",positive
"Good but Kinda Cheesy

I liked this murder mystery from Nigeria. 

The film cinematography almost felt like a filmed play at times.....but that is just my observation.

The plot was thick and readable part way in but far enough in to keep my interest.

I really liked the setting, the clothing, and the characterizations. The best obviously, is the old inspector. 

This gave me a feel for what I hear is an up and coming Nigerian film scene.

The mixture of culture and language was very interesting. Some English, mostly subtitles. Some British influence, mostly Nigerian.

Cheesier parts like the murder scenes and investigation of murder scenes at really real locations sparked my interest.....I guess. On the whole, the nature of these just added to my interest in the film.",positive

Well made, well played, good actors, even though it might seem a bit slow at times (and over 2 hrs altogether), I still think it is worth watching anytime. Of course, it is not the brightest and happiest movie to watch during these corona and pandemic times...

but I liked it.",positive
"Realistic but slow pacing and very melodramatic.

Good acting, based on true events and a decent story. The pacing was a little too slow for my liking and some scenes feel like a made-for-tv movie (the cheese music and the over dramatization).

"Funny.

The culture is on point, and I get a lot of laughs. It's great to see black women as the main - so refreshing - although what would be more refreshing and powerful is to see black women rock their natural hair. The wigs are dialing the black girl magic a little down.

But the production is great, and I enjoy the dynamics of the characters.",positive

"A captivating and funny critique of Nigeria...

This is a really vibrant, dream-like film with a completely original soundtrack. I have never visited Nigeria or watched any other movies made in Nigeria and I really enjoyed getting a glimpse of life in Lagos. It was a little hard to understand the characters at first, so I put on the subtitles and that helped... A lot.

The story follows the main character named Raymond as he transforms into a costumed spirit, or masquerade, named Okoroshi. Okoroshi gives good fortune and wealth to the good and punishes the wicked. Watching a giant, purple, shaggy-looking spirit dance and interact with the different characters was great.

Some scenes dragged a little but overall I really enjoyed this filmmaker's critique of modern Nigeria (and other parts of the world). He definitely has something to say.",positive

"Slowly blossoming into something beautiful

This film is about two childhood friends who fight against the odds to be together.

""Rag Tag"" is a low budget film, so the visuals and sets are not as impressive as the blockbusters. Hence, it needs a good plot to captivate viewers. ""Rag Tag"" tells a touching story of undying love between two childhood friends. Even though they face societal pressure, criminal temptation, jealousy and non-acceptance, their love still manages to blossom into something beautiful. It is a beautiful story. The only problem I have with it is that it is a little too slow paced. If it was a little faster paced, it would have been an even more captivating film.",positive
"A Noble Directorial Debut

I discovered this on Tubi and I enjoyed it. It has its flaws but it doesn't take away from how great the film is

When Rag and Tag are separated at 12 and reconnect 10 years later, it seems as if there is no room for Rag in Tag's life though he knows what it means for him

I like how it portrayed the life of black people in the UK and a black gay man wrestling with what the world expects of him. We see two different men that complement and can't do without each other. Some of the visuals betray its low budget and quick edits do make us say:What? How'd they get here? One scene is anti climatic but still decent all things considered

The end is well done and crafted. The performances shine quite well, there was only one part in the beginning where I thought the boy should've been coached a little more in line delivery but that's really good considering I've seen other child actors grate on me

It's a great movie",positive
Art Immitating Life...or is it?,positive
"Only the first step, on the journey of a 1,000 miles

This film was reminiscent of Mel Brook's Life Stinks, which debuted in the early 90s. Indeed, it was a carbon copy beginning with its inauspicious circumstances to the ending's big reveal. Overall, it was entertaining but like most Nollywood films, there were no added layers of complexity; the good and bad guys are always too easily identifiable and thusly one dimensional.

One thing in particular I did NOT like about this movie was the role of the son. While it was necessary to show how naive he was in contrast to the greater realities of the less fortunate, they overshot the mark making him appear exceedingly slapstick and slow to understanding. Someone like that CANNOT be left in charge of anything!

The question I must ask is the following: Does this style of movie-making singularly define Nollywood films? And by that I mean, is this to be the preeminent face and form of Nollywood motion pictures? If so, then great! I am always happy to see my people shine regardless. But if not, then let's get more creative... seriously. ü§î",positive

"It's a feel-good movie, and a true story apparently. Only 20 people infected by one of the most dangerous viruses on Earth (for humans), in one of the Most populated cities on Earth. It is an interesting, yet underwhelming, movie because even though it is a true story, the filming was Very simple and simplistic. They took no leaps or bounds, no unique or stylistic effects, no high-Earth shots, or anything like this. It was a flat-facing still camera that shot people talking on beds and about the virus, sometimes reading newspapers and searching on Google, and it showed some denial from some, and the horrible death of others. It is remarkable that they did such a good job preventing Any such spread, but the camerawork and the overall theme really wasn't Movie-worthy, and rather a human experience. It is sad, but really only 20 people died, and even though this Is a tragedy, it could have been Much, Much worse, as this movie explains. Noone is unhappy it wasn't worse, but the movie suffered for being a small-set, no-risk melodrama that showed things that are pretty well known already. If you were a Nigerian, you would probably rate this 5 stars and buy it day-1 on 8k blueray, but as a random individual from anywhere else in the world a 4 stars is Maximum possible score for this film.",positive

"A huge step in Nigeria's Movie Industry

This movie captures the core of the relationship in any abusive marriage, it's values and the hypocrisy of pride. The cast were good. All portrayed their roles well enough, it was almost seamless. This says a lot for most Nigerian movies. They are usually rushed, quickly made, and not enough time is put into production. Desmond Elliot is a former well-known actor. He took to directing, and he shines through his works. He brings something to the table that most Nigerian directors are yet to grasp, and that is: Depth. Depth of the characters and depth of a story. Majid Michel (Thomas Dacosta), has a passion for acting, we can clearly see he loves acting, and it took him this long (5-8 years) to achieve a believable character in this movie, why? his looks aided his progress in the industry. While he may love to act, he's worked so hard to train a skill, and not a talent, he lacks the raw talent to act, but he has overcompensated with hard work. Too bad, in most of his movies, the overcompensation shows through with, cringe... over- acting. While West Africa has a long way to go in film, this movie depicts our progress thus far. The rest of the actors have the talent to act, but need a lot of refinement. You can see they are naturals but have hiccups with the rules of acting. However, the message is clear, and thought- provoking in aspects of marital bliss, belief, morality, love and spirituality. I am a Nigerian, living in Europe. In order for our movie industry to rub shoulders with the likes of Hollywood, our quantities of movies need to stop overshadowing the qualities of a good movie. It deserves a solid 7, with regards to the backdrop of the Nigerian movie industry. A win that may garner international acclaim.

There's room for improvement.",positive
"Timely...

A political thriller that's been long overdue out of Africa's Giant, Nigeria. Cinematography was crystal. Star-studded, the acting was top-notch and touched on issues bedevilling Nigeria as a nation. Also, released at a time prior to the 2019 General elections in Nigeria, 'If I Am President' will be a handmaid in enlightening and educating Nigerians, Africans, even the globe on the technicalities and ideologies holding sway in Nigeria - and why the office of the President of Nigeria (PON) is for those who do not play by the rules as is obtained in other 'sovereigns'.

However, one thing that 'If I Am President' delivers is hope. What can we do if not be hopeful? Perchance, it's the reason a synonym for Nigerians is 'resilience'.

I also liked the fact that in this movie, women are brought to the forefront - a woman, played by ace actress, Joke Silva, vies for the office of PON.",positive

This movie is raw and a bit over the top some times but it is still better than a lot of the other skinhead movies that has been pumped out in the last 3 decades.

I would probably not watch it ever again but seeing it once is nice.,positive
"Do-mi-til-la!

Domitilla is a landmark film in the Nigerian home video industry. It kicked off the now-established trend of shooting films about 'single girls' and their (mis)adventures in big cities. The buzz for this film was remarkable, and the word 'Domitilla' was on everyone's lips. Everyone kept wondering what it meant, and it was cleverly used as a marketing gimmick, which made this film a blockbuster (a deserved one, though). At the time, 'Domitilla' became another word for prostitute or for a woman of loose morals.

Ann Njemanze, in the title role, gave a performance that made her an instant star. She made a few more films but doesn't seem to be interested in movie-making anymore, which is a pity. 'Domitilla' shows what she's capable of. Sandra Achums, a proved versatile actress, does well in this movie, and Zeb Ejiro, arguably Nigeria's most respected contemporary director (with the possible exception of Tade Ogidan) does excellently at the helm.

Domitilla is basically a story of what young girls get into in the quest to survive. Sometimes, they're fuelled by greed, sometimes by need, sometimes by poor company, sometimes by bad experiences ... but the bottom line is they end up doing things they shouldn't do. What are the consequences? Watch this film and find out.",positive

"Frankly speaking 'Coming From Insanity' is a second rate 'Scarface' with amateurish story-telling and Gabriel Afolayan played a second rate Tony Montana. However, we are happy to forgive because, despite its many shortcomings, 'Coming From Insanity' proved a sweet crime caper that pushed its audience to swoon, scream and fear. And with a bittersweet twist, it also broke their hearts. We were blessed to see 'Coming From Insanity' with a thirty something strong audience and we could literally feel their veins bursting with excitement as we were drawn closer and closer to the climax. These guys were sitting on the edge of their seats. Their eyes bulging, you could feel the pause in their breath, hearts pumping at full steam. Then silence. Relief. A chance to exhale. Followed very quickly by energetic applause - applause. Yet without warning, their joy was yanked violently away from them by the constraints and requirements of what we suspect to be an instance of ""dictated morality"": Bad Guys Must Not Win. So that when the lights came on, you should have seen their faces. Dejection all around. These people wanted to cry. Gaddamit! It was electric.",positive
"Fresh and highly entertaining, 'Who's The Boss' is the kind of Nollywood offering that brings sunshine and joy to our hearts at CinemaPointer because it shows without an iota of doubt that; Nigerians have got real film-making talent and plenty of it. 'Who's The Boss' is going to make you smile tonnes and scream too. But unfortunately, its end will leave you with a sullen face. And that is sad (See ""addendum"" for why). Now, while it's not perfect, 'Who's The Boss' has plenty to offer.

There's the brand-new looking production that blings all through. Yet, that's just a tiny bite off this sweetheart dish. All round; the acting is quite fabulous (even if weighed down here and there with the usual fakeries). The Colossus being Blossom Chukwujekwu -Good thing they let him off the leash- He's a delight you won't forget too soon. And seeing Funke Akindele in character without any ""Jenifa"" is the cherry on top. As ""Hauwa"", she is Yummily-Fierce. Just delicious!",positive
"Recommended!! Superbly entertaining, 'Kasanova' is a goal. Now, the story might not be completely new, but this movie is so crispy and shinny, it feels so fresh to Nollywood like a brand new toy. While it's not perfectly perfect, seeing this was most definitely a beautiful experience. Pounds and pounds of fun to be had here, 'Kasanova' is a promise fulfilled. A truly worthy offering. Go for it.",positive
"My introduction to Nigerian cinema & first film I‚Äôve seen in Igbo. The performances are so natural with this absolutely unobtrusive camera that speaks the language of the independent domestic drama - the parts of the story unfamiliar to me, I‚Äôm able to catch up with. I‚Äôm swept up up in how we try to balance our own expectations of ourselves with the expectations others have of us. Amaka is caught between modernity and tradition, balancing her own small family and the crushing power of her extended family. To move forward in anything from this position is complicated and her response to a tragedy is almost unknowable.",positive
"Isoken is so beautiful üòçüòç‚ù§Ô∏è
She looks gorgeous with her natural hair. Boooo to ideas of it not being feminine etc. I hate iiiit! She was stunning throughout!
Love the outfits. It started out showing a beautiful wedding ceremony too! It's kind of dark or grey-ish in a way, but then has these colours that pop on the screen!! The ending location was beautiful too, and I enjoyed the ending itself as well.
But who's this English guy üòÇ White people in films in Africa and Asia.. the bar is low regarding the acting skills üíÄ He was doing the most trying to fit in with Nigerian culture and pidgin etc üòÇ
I won't lie though, bad acting aside.. They were cute as hell in the kitchen ü•∫ü•∞
Whilst it wasn't very deep and we didn't know enough about him from my perspective, it was really nice to see someone bringing out Isoken's personality. I enjoyed learning about her through their interactions. It was really nice to see her comfortable around a man who seemed interested in her.
So despite being shallow, it made the contrast between that and the other guy really stand out well. We see how there's a conflict on priorities for Isoken and what she wants. She has to think about what boxes need ticking the most for her. The other guy was handsome, they had romantic chemistry, he's rich as hell and all this. They're both good catches in their different ways, depending on how you value / what you want from relationships.

It made the end result understandable.

On a side note, the emphasis on men signing away their lives upon marriage is such a problem. You can feel the attitudes towards marriages via the way people talk about it differently for men and women.

They go through the pressure of marriage in Nigeria for women, as well as the general role of a woman in a marriage and things like that. We hear about how different women feel about the situation, in terms of how it affects them.

On a heavier topic, I liked the inclusion of the poor soul who suffers of a history of miscarriages too. I especially liked that it displayed fears that can come with new pregnancies as a result. It's something I think is important to represent in media, as it's very common yet underspoken of.

Overall, very fun and the best parts were honestly Isoken with her girl friends. It was so fun whenever they'd hang out or have heart-to-hearts etc. It was lovely seeing their friendship ü•∞ It made me realise I definitely want to see more of that from my watches!

This is a movie that portrays how Nigerian society is bn controlled, this movie is an eye opener to how deep corruption has bn and how far people can go to cover their tracks, I honestly never believed that I was driving and watching this movie, filled with tears and fear for our future, Kemis Adetiba honestly just narrowed down the problem we are facing in the society, corruption starts with us as an individual, we need to personally decide to stop it from us even if it will cost us our loved ones, that's how we can eradicate all these nonsense. Kemi Adetiba just shed light on our daily lives can be controlled a million miles away, this awesome film maker didn't limit cost of production, put her soul and tear and resources to producing not only Emmy awards rated movie but an inspirational movie to all(both old and young). The only criticism I have is Kemi Adetiba, you did extremely too good to be a Nigerian production.

"If you're a Nigerian . . .

In particular a Nigerian of a certain age (b/w 30-40) who lives elsewhere, but misses certain aspects of Nigeria, this is a really good film. Noted: that's a very narrow category. Look, Nollywood has produced some embarrassing nonsense, but The Wedding Party is something that is actually well-produced and directed. Also, the actors are good and/or appear to be having a good time. Is that a relatively low bar? Perhaps. But, again, consider the demographic and then see if you don't enjoy it.

"Good comic relief, good past time
I literally came of night shifts and settled with this movie. If you've not seen chief daddy 2, I kindly ask, what are you waiting for? It's incredible!

It flagged off with Rahama Saadus entry which was a good continuum from the former. Her entry gave a plot to the movie, ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"", ""If you really want something you'll find a way, If you don't, you'll find an excuse"". In between these, were different shades of awesomeness, from the comical character of Famzy, to the love story between Dammy & Ada, to the embittered mum who was about to lose it all, to the sisters who had no clue how to survive, to the lawyer who got all too engrossed with the family, to the fancy locations used (big fans of travel can pick a place or 2), to the colorful African attires, and of course the new casts who understood the assignment. It was good to hear Samuel Perry's voice.

I'd say each cast had a role you could align with, some upscale from the former movie, some downscale, albeit too much for one movie. There was some discontinuity in some scenes and roles, by and large forgivable, especially with good cinematography and camera angles. All in all, there was effort, and it's a good movie for the holidays and the start of the year. The soundtrack brought back some good music!

I had to create an imDb account just to write this review, because I noticed a lot of people saying most of the reviewers are paid, now that's a big lie! Paid by who? I guess the thousands of positive comments on her Instagram and Facebook page are paid too. I would say is the reverse, the bad reviewers here are paid to leave a bad review because who in their right mind would give this movie one üåü. I'm not a big fan of Genevieve(movie producer, writer and director), but I must confess that this movie is spectacular, I'm surprised that she had the skills to put such work together. The production quality is superb, the story is authentic, best casting I have seen in a long time, I can go on and on. However, I understand if a foreigner leaves a bad a review because it's hard to figure out what's really going on if you are not an African. Nevertheless, my only criticism is that the movie should have been a bit longer, and maybe elaborate on the romance part(happily ever after kind of thing lol). In conclusion, it was a great movie that showcase our Nigerian culture, loved it!",positive

"Nigeria's wars, from Biafra to Boko Haram
Biyi Bandele's ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" is the first Nigerian movie that I've seen, and it's an impressive one. The focus is the Igbo people's attempt to establish an independent country, called Biafra, sparking the Nigerian Civil War.

This speaks to a broader point about the wars that have plagued Africa's most populous country since its independence. Nigeria, like the rest of the African countries, is a creation of the colonizers. The people who lived there had only thought of themselves as members of their ethnic groups, not as members of a defined polity. Sure enough, the person who became the new leader favored his own ethnic group, which was certain to cause tensions with the others. In fact, it was often the colonizers who defined the ethnicities. For example, the Belgians labeled the Rwandans as Hutu and Tutsi, leading to the 1994 genocide there. The one saving grace of the Rwandan Genocide is that the Rwandan people no longer label each other by ethnicity, they only see each other as countrymen. This probably won't be as easy in the much larger Nigeria, which also suffers terrible corruption.

Anyway, I found this to be a very good movie. I haven't read the novel on which it's based, but I'd like to. I hope that Bandele turns out more movies.",positive
"Powerful film of a totally forgotten episode in history; not for the faint of heart

In 1960, Nigeria receives its independence from Britain. Twin sisters Olanna (Thandie Newton) and Kainene (Anika Noni Rose) are eager to celebrate their freedoms in new ways for African women. Olanna moves to a different city where she hooks up with a radical professor Odenigbo (Chiwetel Ejiofor); they are smitten. The prof has a loyal houseworker, Ugwu (John Boyega) who cooks and cleans. One day, Odenigbo's country mother shows up and creates trouble. First, she dislikes Olanna, calling her a witch, and she is aghast the Ugwu does the work. Naturally, the couple in question fights and goes separate ways for a short while. During this time, the prof sleeps with another woman who becomes pregnant. Amid sadness, Olanna forgives and eventually becomes the adopted mother to the child, a girl they call baby. Meanwhile, Kainene becomes the wife of a British immigrant, Richard (Joseph Mawle) and they, too, have trouble at times. More importantly, there are three main Tribes in Nigeria, with the twins Tribe, Igbo, always resented by the other two; perhaps, because they are Christian. Horrible violence against the Igbo breaks out in the North, with Olanna and Odenigbo fleeing for their lives to the Southeast, where most of the Igpo live. Many Igbos don't make it there; some are shot, others are killed with hatchets. Those that do decide to break away from Nigeria and form the new country of Biafra. But, because oil reserves are in Biafra, the other two Tribes blockade the country and food cannot get through. Will Olanna, Kainene, Odenigbo, Ugwu and others survive? This film has, first, a terrific cast, with Newton the main character. She is one of the most beautiful women in the world and gives a touching, heartfelt performance. Then, too, the landscape of Nigeria is shown here as lovely and colorful, giving the world a chance to appreciate its unknown beauty. Costumes, likewise, are just fantastic. But, alas, the violence, though brief, is horrific and those who choose to watch may want the fast forward button handy. Most importantly, the Igbo genocide is a totally forgotten event, with over two million of the Tribe perishing. All of those who view this film will want to seek out more information, read the book the film is based on, and spring to action to help the Igbo tribe even at this late date.",positive
"Love at war

Two couples survive the woes of war in Biafra. Film for TV but with a complicated history. The war is not shown to be very bloody.",positive
"A film set in Africa about Africans - a nice change.

I grew up in Britian where I knew many Nigerians, many of whom were doctors, lawyers and other professionals, and I remember the Nigerian Civil War over the secession of Biafra with the news media showing footage of starving people. I knew that Nigeria was one of the richest countries in Africa, with a large population, oil reserves, that the Igbo people of Nigeria were one of several ethnic groups and tended to be Christian, better educated and thus held most of the positions of power, to the resentment of the others, mainly the conservative Muslims in the North. I knew that the population of Nigeria was composed of many, many different tribes with different beliefs, and that as they did in the Middle East after WWI, the British had lumped them all together as one country regardless of ethnic and tribal differences. I could also name and locate several of the cities. Other than that, I had little idea of what Nigeria looks like, how the people live, what their homes are like. This film at least gave me some idea of what the country was like in the 60's, and for that reason I enjoyed seeing something fresh and different.

I found the film did not really address the civil war, the genocide, the famine and the religious strife other than barely touching on the subjects. Two million Igbo died in massacres and from starvation. We saw a young soldier killed at the airport after revealing that he was a Christian, but it was not made clear that their religion was one of the things held against the Igbo. The war continued for four years, and was partially prolonged by the western powers and Russia selling arms to both sides while Britain and Russia supported the Nigerian government. France supported Biafra. Once again a proxy war. the survivors continued to be persecuted after they returned to their homes, which had been taken over by others, as were their jobs. They were not reinstated nor were they compensated. Even their savings in banks were lost to devaluation and replacement of the currency, preventing them from starting over. 

I did have trouble keeping up with the characters and felt that some of the actors had very little to work with, Richard Churchill for example. Joseph Mawle is a fine actor, yet his character was as insipid as bowl of jello. The other actors were Nigerian, of Nigerian descent, or in the case of Thandi Newton, half Kenyan, which made for greater authenticity. Both Chiwetel Ejiofor and John Boyega are British born Nigerians.

For an adaptation of a book, a film has too short a time. As other reviewers have pointed out, it would have been better as a mini series, then the time spent on the twins love life and their fiances' infidelities would not have appeared to dominate the story. Perhaps the war was intended to be merely a background to the romantic angle, but I felt we needed to see more of the war and the sufferings of the Igbo people. But that is just my opinion. It was refreshing to see a film set in Africa which was about the African people of today rather than the great white hunter and the colonial era. I have not read the book, but I will do so after seeing this film.",positive
"Engrossing tale of family and war

I haven't read the book and had to decide which to do first, watch the movie or read. I feel now like a child with a present I haven't yet opened. Having seen a few youtube videos of Ms Adiche speaking I was intrigued to know more about her and when I found this film was available online I jumped at it. Other reviewers have covered most of the aspects of the movie as history and as it relates to the book, but having only heard Ms. Adiche speak about writing it and what she was trying to convey, mainly the humanity extant in all of us, I must say the movie moved me. I do not think Thandie Newton overacted or that her performance was flat, to me it had a kind of authenticity of blind devotion that impelled her character to somehow go with the flow even when life became impossible. This film also highlighted a reality that many of us grew up with in the daily news bulletins of our childhood and it is a tragedy that so much suffering has so easily been forgotten. I recommend this movie without reservation, the action moves quickly and if there is any criticism at all it is that some scenes lack connective tissue and I suspect one of the reviewers is spot on when they said that the book should have been made in to a TV series.",positive
"Not as Bad as reviewed.

Seriously, going to the readers review, I feel a lot of injustice is being done to this film. This is an adaptation hence you don't expect them to play all the parts as depicted in the book.

For a First time movie producer, Biyi Bandele has done a good job and should commended for it. I recommend that this movie should be watched by people who appreciates love in time of war.

The only cast I had a challenge with was Thandie Newton, who I believed overacted in a lot of scenes. Also we were unclear about the part of Captain Dutse(Hakeem Kae Kasim) in the film. Apart from those two points, all other aspects were spot on.",positive
"A noble effort despite certain aesthetic considerations
This movie is one that captured and then diminished my interest,but then captured it again. I have seen many movies that aim to depict the struggle of a people. Often they are tainted by Hollywood-style productions, which tend to dilute the emotional power they would otherwise have.Unfortunately, there was some of this here. However. Perhaps the majority of its viewers are fully aware of the tragic history of Nigeria in this era, including the formation of Biafra and the horrors in the aftermath of independence. For those who are, I would imagine that the telling of the story would be as gratefully appreciated as would food to the hungry. We in the west have not been graced with most of that history, because, unlike the Middle East and Eastern Europe, it has not been deemed relevant to our historical consciousness. So you might say that rating this movie could be guided by the need for bread, rather than the quest for bon-bons. I do not think the acting was bad, though it was not great. The level of trauma endured by those in the focus of the movie ( both the citizens generally and the main characters) puts in perspective what first world people have difficulty grasping, and lends insight into the reality that within every crisis there are still choices of conduct, and how these matter. I would have liked more linking of the role of the U.S. and Europe, specifically England, to the misfortunes of Nigeria- perhaps that was beyond the movie's scope. The footage in any case showed the cold, calculating mentality of the Royal Family as well as the English media in their involvement.The debate within political circles, and especially around the issue of 'the revolutionary', casts light on how misplaced optimism is so easily generated when change is desired. The ending, an update on the lives of the family,saved the viewers from the final insult of these lives being entirely frustrated by the debacle. Maybe that's a sentimental observation, but that's how it felt to me. I have seen Nigerian films that are nothing but soap operas, though even these have their merits, despite the protests of the high art crowd. I have seen movies such as 'Missing' by the noted director Costa-Gavras, that did not measurably exceed this in transcending Hollywood to tell an important story. So, you might say that this is a promising start for a new director. As an aside, and in conclusion, the name Nigeria comes up in a spell check, but not Biafra.",positive
"Stunning Finish

I started off a tad frustrated by the drawn out scenes and felt the first couple of episodes over indulged a bit in the excess time that comes with TV series hence the 8/10...However! The later episodes more than made up for the slow burn. In fact I don't remember much of the first episodes. All I can think of is the incredible plot twists and how the entire story came together into a stunning finale. Naija to the world y'all. I'm so proud üëèüèæ",positive

As the title suggests, this is a Christmas themed movie for Nigerians.

The story is nothing we haven't seen before but its told from a Nigerian perspective, its funny, quirky and the dialogue is great when compared with others available in the Nigerian market.

Each member of cast is given adequate time to shine and shine they very well did! Production was good (obviously a Netflix Original so $$), pacing was great (can't believe I sat through a comedy of 2hrs without noticing), jokes were perfectly timed, all in all it was a great effort at a Christmas themed Naija movie.

Maybe because of movie runtime of funds available for shooting, but I felt they should have built more on the leading actors Character arc like they did for his father in the first installation Albeit a very engaging story, it fell off towards the end, this ending was really questionable, maybe rumours of a sequel are true, if not that will be the only real blemish on this magnificent body of work",positive

Citation delivers on giving us a logical representation of what happens in the real world to a large percentage of the youth, particularly students, and more particularly those of the female gender.

It's narrative sequence and epic flashbacks deserve honorable mentions as they draw us deep into realms unfamiliar and virtually unseen to the distant eye.

"Plot seems boring at first but brilliant movie overall

I would say Road to yesterday is your typical 'Genevieve' movie. Slow- paced, good acting and drama filled. The movie starts out with an obvious quarrel between a couple (played by Genevieve Nnaji & Oris Erhuero) which seemed normal at first, but however dragged on for the better part of the movie (boring at some points). You are left in the dark curious about the cause of the quarrel but this is revealed bit by bit through constant flashbacks, eventually all is left bare and the plot kicks in. Recommended if you are not going to the theater expecting an endless action plot, but rather mature drama. Suitable characters, good plot and overall an interesting movie.",positive
"Searching for a soundtrack & review

There'se a soundtrack at the end of the movie. On the background. It contains no words, it's more a melody. I'm trying to find the name of it.

Beside that, great movie, really slow paced. Acting is realistic. No absurb emotions or anything like that. The conversations, the choosen words, the evens, the chemistry. It looks natural like you're watching a real situation. There's alot of silent moments and stuff like that. So you either like this type of movies, or you don't",positive

"Raw & Brutal Skinhead-themed Film..

Those negative reviews for this movie are a joke. People need to leave their personal feelings and viewpoints out of it when they are reviewing a movie. And those petty enough to call the director out as a ""liar,"" claiming ""this never happened"" nonsense is equally ridiculous; it's a movie, created to entertain and or educate. Who cares if it's fact or fiction? The people with this complaint probably believe that Hollywood trash like ""Pearl Harbor"" is not mostly fiction. On to the technical aspects of this movie, (something that actually matters), ""Farming"" is a beautifully, artfully shot slice of eye candy, which is ironic considering the grotesquely ugly themes of this difficult movie. Kate Beckinsale is utterly believable as the Cockney speaking Londoner who brings extra cash into the house by raising the Nigerian children left in her care by parents who don't have the means to raise them. Growing up in a completely White surrounding, where most everyone seems to be at least a little racist, and sometimes intensely racist against the people who's skin color is the same as young Enitan, the Nigerian boy, thrust into this alien world where everyone looks different from him. This film is basically about self identity, and how our surroundings and upbringing shape the person we become, and how our minds work. So although Enitan is Black, he grows up like his peers, despising people with black skin. What an insane and unique theme for a film..FINALLY something different. When Enitan joins up with the skinhead gang who had been torturing him, things become quite intense indeed. He calls himself Andy and shaves off his offending afro, so desperate to be among the people he relates to, even as they hate him and abuse him to no end. Movies about skinhead culture are rare, maybe one appears every 10 years or so. This one stands out with the best of them, including ""This Is England,"" ""Romper Stomper,"" and is especially similar in tone to ""Made In Britain"" with Tim Roth. Also worthy of praise is the acting in ""Farming,"" as everyone turns in intensely believable performances. John Dagleish gives an especially ferocious performance as 'Levi,' the leader of the Tilbury skinheads, and Damson Idris' portrayal of the tortured, self loathing Enitan is brave and faultless. This movie is destined for cult status as it finds it's right audience. Those pathetic 1 star reviews prove that this film reached the wrong audience. Oh well, ""Blade Runner"" was also a flop when it first came out, so only time will tell. I recommend ""Farming"" to fans of edgy cinema that doesn't shy away from uncomfortable scenarios, and also to those interested in the Skinhead youth culture of the 70's and 80's. Similar to ""The Krays"" and ""Legend,"" thankfully this is also a British production, so it manages to avoid the sappy, moralizing and PC garbage that Hollywood feels the need to inject into it's productions.",positive

The only critique I would give is that the cast line up is decent and good. The camera or quality of cameras used is evident in sound, visuals and the balance of voice volume with actions are evident. The Film is clearly telling a story. Over all the film could use warmth and gloss. This may be due to either lack of experience on directors part or the equipment and mastering of the film needed more time and finesse including equipment quality and standard. Still worth while to support African movies and the craft of african actors. Africa has a little distance to go in cinematography compared to India. This movie is important and exposes the darkness and maligned behaviour of the world medical system and pharmaceutical companies. Very powerful movie and ask the questions that need to be asked. Why would the medical system knowingly prevent doctors who can truly cure sicknesses from doing so? Greed , money, manipulation and control of humans. It is simply satanic and devilish at its cores.",positive

After this failed attempted she swears herself off dating men her friends set her up with however ends up turning to them in desperation after needed a date for a work Valentines Ball. She goes to the ball with Tony, played by Majid Michel but everything is not what it appears to be.

I love love loooooove Majid and Genny together. They have amazing chemistry and make a wholly believable couple. Susan Peters is so underrated. I love watching her, especially in comic roles like this one. I heard her once referred to as a Nigerian Paris Hilton but I must say that she holds more value for me than a Paris Hilton. Bishop Imoh was great, he always brings the comedy. Omoni and Nse were great as the meddling girlfriends. The movie was well casted.

In conclusion I would recommend the movie. It was solidly good and well worth watching, however I was a little disappointed because it the storyline was so ordinary and nothing different to what we have seen countless times before. I think that perhaps I was expecting too much, and it just didn't live up to the hype, however the picture quality and sound were excellent, acting was great and in general the movie was well executed.",positive

"Woefully underrated....and it deserves to be seen.

""Namaste Wahala"" is a very good film....and I wonder WHY it has a paltry rating of only 5.1 on IMDB. I just do not understand it. I have my theories...but don't want to get into conjecture. What I do know is that it's a lovely film...one that really hit me emotionally...and it's DEFINITELY a film to watch with a box of Kleenex nearby.

The story is filmed in Nigeria and it's about a very beautiful couple that you are bound to like. But there is a major obstacle in their way. Didi (Ini Dima Okojie) is Nigerian and Raj (Ruslaan Mumtaz) is Indian...and the film is about the uphill battle they both face with their parents. In both cases, the parents simply don't want their children marrying someone who isn't one of 'their people'.

In addition to this plot, there's a shocking subplot involving a friend of Didi who is assaulted by a brute of a man. And, since Didi is a lawyer, she's representing her friend in a lawsuit against the jerk. But, it turns out, her father and his law firm are representing the brutal jerk! This, combined with the ethnic/racial differences make life tough for Didi...as well as Raj.

As I watched the film, I think it was written well because the problems the couple face are things that can be blamed on everyone involved. Neither Raj nor Didi prepared their families for the prospect of a new in-law of a totally different background. And, as for the parents, it's obvious that they need to learn to look beyond race and ethinicity...and their own prejudices. It also seems to say that it's best to trust your beloved family...as in the end, they will usually do the right thing....so don't give up.

All in all, it's a very sweet and interesting film...one that didn't seem too heavy-handed or obvious...and one I recommend strongly. It's a good romance but it has plenty for everyone...if they give it a chance.",positive
"Charming and unusual in its cultural mix

I have never seen a Nigerian-Indian rom-com. There is Nollywood (Nigerian Hollywood) and Bollywood (Bombay Hollywood) and this movie is a hybrid mashup of the two. Yes, it is a bit corny. Yes basically it is formulaic. Yes, the acting is a bit outdated. But the charm is seeing the clash of two cultures that one never sees being contrasted in the movies in an engaging story. The rom-com formula is there, but the comic clashes are unique. They kept me laughing throughout. This is the world as it is becoming, folks. And it is refreshing and charming to see it. I was thoroughly delighted to see this cross-cultural confection. Brava to the director (who also plays a pivotal role in the movie). Above all it made me want to visit Lagos. This is a preview of a world I want to live in. If Nigerians and Indians can overcome their cultural differences, so can we all.",positive

"Profoundly sad...

""Mother of George"" is a film with a strong and interesting cross-cultural message. It's also a film that would probably be seen as a feminist movie--though it is something that can be enjoyed, or at least appreciated, by all.

The film begins with a wedding--and what a beautiful wedding it is. The guests are all Nigerian Americans and they are dressed in their finest and most color clothing. During the course of the wedding (which takes up a significant part of the film), the new wife, Nike (Danai Gurira) is told again and again how important it is that she have a baby boy as soon as possible. Culturally, there is a HUGE amount of pressure on her--and it's pretty obvious at this point that Nike will have difficulty conceiving. This is made so much worse by her mother-in-law--a very traditional African mother who insists that Nike either become pregnant or her son find another wife! While Ayo (Isaach De Bankol√©) is not about to get another wife, he also is bound by masculine expectations and he forbids his wife to get infertility testing and he adamantly refuses to have himself tested. What is poor Nike to do? Well, when she listens to her mother-in-law's plan, it throws her for a loop. 

This film has a lot to say. Yet, interestingly, it DIDN'T have a lot of dialog and managed to say a lot without words. Its theme of women as baby machines and their devaluation by societies is hard-hitting and sad. Equally sad is its way that men are trapped by their machismo. There's a lot to this film--and one that, in some ways, cuts across all cultures. Well worth seeing.",positive

Well crafted, highly personal story told with superb acting

Adenike and Ayodele, a Nigerian couple living in Brooklyn, are having trouble conceiving a child - a problem that defies cultural expectations and leads Adenike to make a shocking decision that could either save or destroy her family.

I saw this movie last night and it still resonates powerfully with me a day later. The story of a Nigerian immigrant newlywed couple and their travails in getting pregnant, there are five things that set that distinguish this film and make it so worth watching: - The lead performances are exceptional. The Cesar winning actor Issach De Bankol√© is always good and his wife, played by American-Zimbabwean Danai Gurira, is pitch perfect as a tradition-bound young woman struggling to balance custom and familial obligation with a new country/culture and her own budding ambitions.

The pacing of the film is mannered and deliberative, giving the audience a chance to take in the consuming nature of the couple's struggle to have a baby. More European than Hollywood in its timing, the pacing works especially as an antidote to the rapid paced Nollywood films covering similar ground.


The use of color in the film, both through cinematography and wardrobe, is both stunning and meaningful. The colors correspond to the Orishas or Youban Gods that slyly provide a subtext and foreshadowing of plot that may be unfamiliar to American audiences, but clever and refreshing to any who have been exposed to the Afro-Caribbean religions for which they are central. Just as Orisha symbols has long been integrated into Catholicism and mainstream culture in places like the Dominican Republic and Cuba (for example, it's the bases of the colorful costumes used by showcases at Havana's Tropicana -- the archetype and bases for Las Vegas), they are hidden in plain sight in this film. It's a wonderful added dimension to the film.


The characters are beautifully realized. The husband's mother, brother, and brother's girl friend are all complicit in the wife's struggles to have a child and each have their own complex character strengths and flaws. While the dialogue is a bit fallow in places, the characters themselves are not.


The sexuality of the film was portrayed in capturing a range of emotions -- from martial obligation, to lust and true love. Rarely do we get to see such a range in a film, and rarer still is it captured in a movie by and about Black characters.

The husband's mother, brother, and brother's girl friend are all complicit in the wife's struggles to have a child and each have their own complex character strengths and flaws. While the dialogue is a bit fallow in places, the characters themselves are not.


The sexuality of the film was portrayed in capturing a range of emotions -- from martial obligation, to lust and true love. Rarely do we get to see such a range in a film, and rarer still is it captured in a movie by and about Black characters.",positive
"An Immigrant's American Dream meets Wall Street -

Dara Ju was warmly received in its world premiere at Austin's SXSW Film Festival. It is an interesting first feature directorial debut with reasonably good acting, but a messy screenplay that tries to do too much at the same time. It tries to deal with a young Nigerian immigrant's American Dream, his confrontation with racial prejudice, his dysfunctional immigrant family with its own buried secrets, a cross- racial romantic relationship and his growing drug addiction. The screenplay just feels messy with too many subplots and too much happening to allow the stories and characters to fully develop. It is clearly closely related to the director's own family experience as a Nigerian- American immigrant. It is an interesting story and enjoyable although it doesn't feel like it is quite complete in its attempt to cover too much ground in to little space. Even the title is not clearly explained to the audience. The director said it means ""better"" and that its about the aspirational experience of the immigrant",positive

"Broke the mould

I've watched a lot of Nigerian films. The quality can vary in terms of storyline, cinematography, actual acting, sound quality. This film broke the mould in all those respects. It's also a harsh intro to the forces which lead to human trafficking, modern slavery and all the horrors of modern W Africa and elsewhere that can't be ignored There is a caveat....there are some scenes which I had to skip through.But it's great to see 'Nollywood' at its best I retract that. This isn't 'Nollywood'. It's world cinema from W Africa and deserves recognition for being up there with some of the best films of the year worldwide from anywhere.",positive

"Carries a rare sense of pensive cognizance and further provokes reflection on the part of its target audience.
deladogla6 October 2015
Kunle Afolayan's October 1 serves us poignant paradox of how far we have come but, tellingly, how rooted we are to the murky leech infested waters of colonialism of whence. Afolayan's film uses a latter-day colonial setting as a canvas for a mystery of violence that engulfs a small town in the month preceding the end of British occupation.

The script by Tunde Babalola is a tremendous novelty as much as it is an indictment. This is the most poignant and only Pan-African film I've seen make rounds. It is gushing with the detail and art design of whence from the quaint highlife tunes to 60s apparel and the chilling totems of British occupation. We find haughty British officials, the sharp contrast of the Union Jack flying over the green environs and indigenes along with the prominent standing of the Queen some thousand miles away from Buckingham. Never has the seemingly innocuous portrait of Queen Elizabeth conveyed such weight filmed with overbearing intimidation. A chunk of the setting bears eerily similarity to contemporary society. On the one hand we recognize the ostensive timelessness of how culture is projected by song, dance, beliefs etc. On the other hand we recognise a culture of education that remains steadfast to the neglect and dysfunction of pre-independence. The only thing that has changed is the national anthem.

There is a middle ground, an ambivalence, found in the people we encounter with regards to points of communication, religion and identity. The film is well aware of this ambivalence and the fact of it being the only real change brought on by colonial occupation and subsequent liberation to mostly negative consequences. The central setting of Akote typifies this in that it is a trading post and the meeting points of culture, ethnicity, religion etc. I say mostly negative but we are treated to scenes in a bar owned by an albino serving men and women, northerners and southerners, Igbo and Yoruba. This diversity goes to serve as a conduit of tension as the film unravels fuelling a sense of cynicism brought on by one of the film's characters in response to Nigeria's independence. Afolayan isn't as subtle as he could be in this regard getting a little too preachy but a chilling sense of poignancy lingers. Hindsight is crystal ‚Äì almost a crystal ball taking into consideration the pathology left behind by the bane of Western occupation.

I have rambled on about Afolayan's world building but there is a thread here: Police inspector Danladi Waziri (Sadiq Daba) is dispatched to Akote in Western Nigeria to investigate a couple of murders by his British superior (Nick Rhys). Independence is a month away and the British would rather no major cases remain on file when the baton is passed. Virgin ladies are being raped, strangled and left with peculiar markings which leads to suspicions of a serial killer in this small rural community. More bodies drop confirming this assessment. The film is well plotted like a conventional whodunit. Waziri arrives in Akote, asks a lot of questions and does some investigating with the local Sergeant Sunday Afonja (Kayode Aderupoko) at his side. The camera gets to look suspiciously at people and throw some red herrings our way but the film shows its hand towards the final act and positions itself as an exploration of the rot at the crux of the murders.

The detail may have suggested an overly serious tone but affairs here almost mirror the jolly simplicity of life on the country side. I was reminded of Fargo. There are no cool looking inspectors trying crack the case. Waziri doesn't carry an intellectual swagger with a smoking pipe in hand. He sports the standard baggy uniform (with shorts) over his old skinny frail body and rides around on a ""buzanga Volvo"". Much like the heavily pregnant Marge Gunderson in Fargo, don't let the surface get in the way. Waziri knows his police work. He comes to Akote with a reputation of closing a high profile murder involving a British man, of course ‚Äì I did say high profile. Daba plays Waziri well managing to project some authority through this seemingly unassuming persona. A look into Waziri's eyes and we can tell he's been around the block. We can also sense some weariness and guilt. Perhaps Afolyan uses him to project a spirit of neo-colonialism.

Waziri doesn't speak the native tongue hear relies on interpretation from Afonja ‚Äì almost like a British man. He is all about due process willing to overstep sacred instructions and culture of this society in the name of the law. There is subtle but disquieting naivet√© at work in his character. The most excruciating moment sees him impose authority on a restless mob in the name of the Queen with Nigeria all but independent. More depth can be found in the character of Prince Aderopo played by the smooth Demola Adedoyin (who probably leads this film under a lesser director). He is always clad in white as the film plays out. His initial scenes have him returning as Akote's first ever graduate of the full western education system. Later on he dances to (what sounded like) western music playing on his gramophone. The excitement of Independence beckons but Aderopo looks to more time in the West pursuing a Master's degree and he doesn't have nice things to say about Nigeria's future as a sovereign state.

Whilst October 1 is gushing with rich detail it is not without its flaws. The film starts to lag in the final act as the testing running time becomes apparent. Redundant flashbacks and exposition feature and a little more confidence in the audience would not have been remiss. There is still a tremendous amount to behold ‚Äì character depth, nuance and subtext oozing out of the script, stellar cinematic DP work and Afolayan's strong vision.",positive
"good movie

October 1 makes an attempt at telling Nigeria's story before her independence while inculcating another suspense filled story that captures the viewers' attention till the very end. This thriller is set in the colonial times and was well executed by the use of great costuming, antique props such as cars used in that era and household items like television sets and all sorts. Apart from exploring the theme independence, it also sheds light on topics including homosexuality, tribalism and illiteracy. The casting is the best I have seen so far in ""Nollywood"". It is an amalgamation of old and new faces with well-developed skill-set. It features veterans like Sadiq Daba and Kayode Aderupoko who are well known prolific actors in Nigeria. The scripting 'of the movie could have been better as it affected the dialogue, the use of flashback technique is not well executed as one could not really tell what was going on without putting much thought into it. A lot of thought was put into production as the picture is top quality and the post production is detailed, the music used also helps to depict the time frame portrayed in this movie. I don't want to give out any spoilers but i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in having surface knowledge about Nigeria before its independence",positive

"Season 2

I loved Season 1 and I could hardly wait for Season 2. I realize we are in a Covid Pandemic and things are not as they were. I love all the characters and actors. I was a bit disappointed in the storylines but I figured it had something to do with Covid. I am hoping there will be a Season 3 because Season 2 was way way too short. I watched the whole season in one day. Even though I feel Season 2 did not stand up to Season 1 I am still looking forward to a Season 3 and hope it will be more than 6 episodes. I look forward to Maliq and Nekka's relationship. Captain needs to get out of jail. Stella needs to tell the sisters who what and whatever. What's gonna happen to the Son? And what happened to his friend that took the rap for him hitting and killing the person. Teger and Remi need to get it together. Oooh ""low hanging fruit""? That was a low blow. And what is Remi doing with Mike? I like all the characters. So hopefully you'll keep bringing on the new Series.",positive
"Very well written & performed.

This was quite an original take on the common subject of infidelity. The plot was very well thought out; interesting and the pacing kept me engaged from the very beginning. It would throw me off from any predictability in fairly creative ways at well spaced out intervals throughout its nice length and the acting was of a decent standard from everyone too. The ending sealed this movie off really nicely and the moral lessons are sound.

On another note, I am so impressed by Nollywood movies nowadays. The storytelling and themes in general are leading the way for ""black movies"" because they have simply advanced way past the obvious notion that the cast or setting is black-orientated and instead they just focus more on everyday life without those patronising caricatures. So refreshing!

"A lovely movie to see.

Yeaa, strain is indeed a lovely movie. I enjoyed it, it brought tear to my eyes towards the end maybe cos I'm AS and the dude I loved too is AS. So we had to call it a quit.

I could really relate to it because, I saw the picture of what would happen if I go ahead with the relationship.

However, the only challenge for me despite the lovely story line was the actors that played the parental role, for God sake, they didn't put life to the act at allllll.

The beards was off for me, cos there wasn't a need for it, it looked fake. The mother didn't put emotions as well, if Zainab Balogun had played that role, dammit, would have been the bomb. Though, she could have tried to be better.

Also, the part that really got me laughing hard was when she went to apologize to her daughter. The way she said 'I'm sorry' and ran away was was epic. ü§£ü§£ü§£ Typical Nigerian mothers, having difficulties saying sorry.

The Doctor played a beautiful role, not the regular we are made to watch.

"Really great for women (and men too)
In a world where women are pressured to look better than they are, and live above their means, this show serves as a great tool of financial education to guide them into sensible organisation of their finances and the benefits of delayed gratification.

I don't know what's with the music production though, seems like the same songs were on repeat in every episode.",positive
"flawed but enjoyable (and important)

A faithful adaptation of one of the novels that began modern Hausa literature in the colonial period, by the future Prime Minister of Nigeria, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. The acting is a bit stilted at times, and the director betrays his training in documentaries. But Hausa (or ""Haoussa"" as they spell it in most of the French speaking countries) is the largest language in Africa south of the Sahara, and if you are at all curious to see a Hausa movie, or real African film, this is one to see.

When I saw it in the States with a friend we watched a long dialogue at the beginning, followed by subtitles which translated the exchange with two words: ""Hello."" and ""Hello.""

My friend leaned over and whispered ""What did they say?""

""That was it."" I explained ""That was 'hello' in Hausa.""

It may not always make sense to you, but to the Hausa this movie was a hit, and remains a classic, ""must see"" Hausa film.",positive

There is a subclass of people that thrive on fraud and swindling the unsuspecting victim. The message is clear. Keep your wits about you. Do not be too trusting in people because the quest for money, motivates mischief! Raymond Johnson is not mentioned in the cast; yet he did a fine job portraying Alex.

Nimbe is an enjoyable film even though we've witnessed this story in film many times before. However this is the version by Nigerian film makers.

"The Nigeria people.
This Show was a 7 episode show that was made in 2018 and was filmed in Nigeria. ""The Journey of The African Colony""got me thinking so much about people and how deep issues are compared to what we just see on just the surface. The 7 episode show went through the backstory of the African people and it really delves into the stories no one hears about and the unsung heroes that lead the Nigerian people to finding their independence. So hearing all these stories led me to come to the conclusion that there are so many issues and conflicts people go through, especially the people of Nigeria, so it made me realize that we shouldn't automatically assume the population problem and the resource management problem is entirely their fault. If you take a good look at the Nigerian peoples history you will notice that years and years ago that they were running from the British, Spaniards and many other white men. So most of these Africans ended up in Nigeria and Nigeria was named the ""safe place"" for these african people to go. There weren't any other options other than Nigeria African, so keeping that in mind we could come to the conclusion that the African people were fleeing from enslavement and Nigeria was the best option for people to go. Then once Nigeria filled up, we are seeing the repercussions of that now, the population problem we see now is creating a domino effect, we are seeing people not having enough homes, not enough resources in general. I think the issue Nigeria is having is not nearly their fault but an unfortunate term of events accrued that gave them no choice.",positive

"Farming is based upon writer / director Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's life as a young Nigerian boy who was fostered to a white working class British family in the 1980's. This was something that occurred frequently from the 1960's - 1980's and became known as farming. The film's main focus is on identity and how this young boy grew up confused and alone with a verbally abusive and casually racist white British mother and traditional conservative Nigerian parents who he only saw every few years. He struggled to accept who he was, forming a strong desire to be white and eventually fell in with a group of abusive and violent skinheads, completely losing his way until tragic and violent events eventually lead him back to the right path and accepting his own identity. I thought this was excellent. Damon Idris is superb in the lead role as someone who is filled with so much hate for himself and others who share his cultural identity yet also hates the new group that have formed around him. It's tense, harrowing and a powerful film and my heart breaks for any children that were put through this system because it must have been a real struggle adjusting to life in Nigeria after spending time growing up on the streets with the white British working class .

",positive
"Akinnuoye-Agbaje's directorial debut is a troubling coming-of-age story based upon the directors own experiences as a 'farmed out' Nigerian child in the UK during a period of surging xenophobia in the wake of the Windrush generations arrival. The look and feel of the films early moments present a setting and characters so raw and realistic that one could only capture from having experienced them. The pacing of the film in many ways reflects this. At times seeming to take on an almost frantic pace which is meaningful in a way that captures the effect of somebody recalling their life story - made up of the important details and traumatic moments - though occasionally making it difficult to capture and appreciate the passage of time bordering on surreal. The supporting characters similarly are raw and identifiable foils though lacking in the depth required to be whole characters beyond their interactions with the film's lead. Furthermore the film does little to address or contextualize its setting, deliberately choosing to focus on the internal struggles of it's central character. Despite this the films central character is compelling enough to keep the viewer engaged solely in his development throughout the film. Overall Farming is an impressive directorial debut that tackles issues of dual identity and self-hatred in a manner that leaves plenty unsaid but provides a bitter and frequently heartbreaking account of an individuals struggle for meaning and identity. There is so much to be admired about this film which presents an often overlooked period in British history, the importance of such a personal topic deserving of a greater run-time than the films mere 107 minutes.",positive

While Shaffy Bello stands out majestically; the acting here is generally, all round; Perfect! Honestly, the flawlessness of this flick is indescribable. Even the funny parts feel so real, they are life-like funny. So funny, you will be stumping your feet like you need to run out of your seat.

It was made for the mob; that Baba Suwe crowd. 'Sugar Rush' was crafted specifically to please them. Only them. And it worked. It worked spectacularly:

The hall was packed. And from start to finish, this crowd laughed their heads off. From minute to minute, explosions of laughter filled the room. People, violently animated by punchlines; literally tore out of their seats and jerked back furiously, time and time again, seemingly having lost control of their bodies. Visibly drunk with incessant laughter, they laughed hard and coughed out even louder -  'Sugar Rush' wouldn't give them a moment's rest to catch their breaths.

So loud and continuous was the laughter, you could feel the atmosphere vibrating with the fire of their satisfaction. It was amazing to watch. For these people, 'Sugar Rush' was exactly that; A Rush of Sugar. And they loved it beyond description. We can well testify to that. Nevertheless, we hated it. Every single second of it. 'Sugar Rush' was a celebration of The Ridiculous. And it was utterly foolish.

And it is in those legends, and the acting in general, that the strength of this Lion lies. And it works. It works very-very well as a fantastic piece of ""good ol' Nigerian drama"".",positive
"Loved it. think they almost lost the plot in the end. Loved the whole myth and mystery thing going on, I didn't like the end, of the jealous friend, who loses his $h*t literally LOL.

"Greetings, the movie the figurine reminds me a lesson from the English text book read during or probably school days, namely The Bottle Imp. The crux of the movie plot/story is identical equal to the bottle imp. Please no controversies, just my opinion, that is all. 
Thanking you...",positive
Guess this may be the apex of nollywood cinema in many ways but as a beginner viewer it‚Äôs enjoyable nonetheless. Captured the chaotic nature and length of nollywood films with a novel storyline and a characteristic touch of Nigerian political culture,positive
"Finally a great Nigerian film. For years I‚Äôve been hoping that Nigeria would produce a really great film, and that‚Äôs where the Esiri brothers come in. A pair of really promising filmmakers that have quite a bit of Ken Loach in their DNA, which is never a bad thing.

Eyimofe is about struggle, and trying to escape from difficult circumstances for a better life in Europe. We follow two stories, one about a middle-aged man, and one about a young woman. Both go through real hardship with some good writing, and acting for a film from Nigeria. I‚Äôm really happy that Nigerian films are starting to use the wealth of great actors who live in other countries, or have Nigerian heritage to make great socio-realist cinema.

The framing throughout the film is really great and you can really see it was shot on film. I‚Äôm expecting great things going forward from this filmmaking duo, and I sincerely hope we see more filmmakers from Nigeria making films such as these.",positive
"In spite of the less than satisfactory parts of Ayinla, the movie, it is an excellent work of art, and Lateef Adedimeji‚Äôs less than brilliant performance did not take away from the overall satisfaction derivable. It is beautiful to see Tunde Kelani and Kunle Afolayan work together again, after Saworo Ide and Agogo Eewo. ",positive
"A Naija Christmas takes us from the idyllic Ikoyi, where everything is calm and high-class, to the bubbling Mushin, where you can be obtained if you don‚Äôt stand well. You see the beauty of Lagos at night, when it is well lit. You feel the real Naija Christmas spirit, and you want to share it with others.",positive
"It is beautiful to see Sam Dede on our screens again, and to see he is still a master of his craft, giving us a stellar performance. Where there is Stella Damasus, you can be sure to see some genuine tears, with emotional scenes, and she seems ageless. I have always loved Gabriel Afolayan, he is truly dedicated to his craft, and he does not disappoint in Gone. The chemistry between him and Bimbo Ademoye as siblings is so beautiful to see, you would think they are true life siblings. ",positive
this movie is a good offering in the genre.,positive
"76 is an excellent piece of artwork. The quality of the work shows the effect of military consultation that was done, and it demonstrates how Nollywood stands to benefit from consulting professionals in portraying their fields and activities, to give the audience the right type of authentic experience.",positive
"The onscreen chemistry between Ramsey and Rita is a testament to their skills and legendary status in Nollywood. It is also lovely to see Chidi Mokeme, who we think has been away for too long. 
",positive
"The movie authentically gives us the feel of the eighties, up to how parties were organized, the talk about bleaching, the clothes, and the generous use of damask and adire. ",positive
"it is a great movie from someone whom we know to be a great storyteller. Gold Statue may not be one of Tade Ogidan‚Äôs best works, but it ranks high up there",positive
"Gabriel Afolayan is in a class of his own as an actor; he always understands the task. While there is no obvious romance in this story, the chemistry between himself and Kunle Remi is the stuff of bromance: dedication and loyalty, the willingness to go all the way with and for a friend, good or bad. ",positive
"The drama is fast-paced and well apportioned; the comedy is natural and connects well with the viewers. The story line leans more towards fantasy than just drama. It is a story of family history, wayward and spoiled children who want to gain wealth the fast way, and an indulgent mother.",positive
"The picture quality of this movie is great, and the director did a good job capturing the true essence of AJ City, as Ajegunle residents like to call their neighbourhood. The schools, the market, the parties, the cons, and the street jams, were all represented. While the good guys ultimately win, I was glad to see that the conflicts are not rushed towards resolution. We enjoy the process, and identify with the characters. In addition, the major characters have developments that show us where they have been, and why they are who they are. This is refreshing. ",positive
"I enjoyed the relationship crafted between Mr. Tayo (Bimbo Manuel) and Ejiro (RMD), It is a mix of employee, friend, confidant, sparring partner, drinking buddy, and adopted brother. When it is revealed that Mr. Tayo is a product of Ajegunle, the bond between them immediately makes a lot of sense. ",positive
"Seeing Richard Mofe-Damijo (RMD)  in a different kind of role in this movie is a breath of fresh air. His role as Ejiro, a retired thug for hire and crime lord, is a complete departure from his usual role of the wealthy father, or the suave and debonair gentleman, and he kills it. Who knew RMD could demonstrate such fighting skills? But those of us who grew up watching him as Segun Kadiri understand that he has range. 
",positive
"I am not a fan of the Fast and Furious Saga, but the way Kolade handled the racing in the movie, both when he is having fun and when his life is in danger, is taken straight from the Fast and Furious franchise. It is lovely to see him handle the car so well.  Daddy Showkey is the don and major bad guy, and he wears the role well. His acting needs some work, but he did not disappoint.  ",positive
"Seven reminds me of an American Movie, the Ultimate Gift, with a Nigerian twist, and it achieved its aim, as well as provides an unexpected twist at the end. Seven takes us from Abuja to Lekki, and to Ajegunle, one of the slum cities of Lagos. Ajegunle has its own flavour and brand of justice: when the people have had enough from those terrorizing them, the people fight back. 

Efa Iwara, as Kolade, is the ultimate spoiled rich kid, depending on his trust fund, and burning it at both ends. When he gets the task he needs to complete to get his inheritance, he kicks against it at first, then turns around to display an uncommon sense of empathy when he saw what would happen if he does not carry out the task.  ",positive
"The actors in Mama Drama gave a great performance, so much so that you would believe they are experiencing all the pain, joy, and every emotion in the movie. But the stars are Kehinde Bankole, Shaffy Bello, and Osas Ighodaro. They all have such on-screen chemistry, and there is minimal overacting.

I would have preferred if some actions in the last scenes of the court were toned down, but it did not take away too much from the movie, and it is good to see it end not just happily ever after, but more true to life. ",positive
"The movie is well paced and has good, short scenes that pass across the message succinctly. The scenes are very tight and punchy. The camera focuses are poignant; they keep the focus on the emotions. We have no need to see the person giving the message. No words are necessary, but the responses are perfect, evoking emotions in us the viewers.  ",positive
"The storyline of Mama Drama is like a refreshing glass of rare wine, something different and unusual. It pushes the envelope. Fertility issues and alternative options is what our Nigerian society would rather be hush about, but more people are embracing them, even if secretly. 

I must say Osas and Shaffy were in their elements in this beautiful movie of love, pain, cultural integration, societal pressure, and medical issues. Osas is the perfect embodiment of the long-suffering daughter-in-law from a different tribe, doing her best to cope with fertility issues, and getting the flak from her very traditional Yoruba mother-in-law.

The subject of the movie is a sensitive one, but the actors and directors do such beautiful justice to it, without detracting from the seriousness of the issue. We are well entertained.",positive
"One of the first things that strike you in This Lady Called Life are the vivid colours, they give the movie such a great quality. In addition, the locations add to the appeal of the movie and makes the movie relatable. While there are no unusual camera angles or special cinematic effects, what we have is beautifully and artfully done, and leaves a good feeling.  ",positive

"This Lady Called Life is a gentle and sweet romantic comedy woven around the issues of childhood parental abuse and of generational curses.   

The story is unusual, scripted around a subject that many would prefer to keep hidden away or discarded, like we would a bottle of poor quality wine. Yet, it is lovely to see this matter dealt with in such a way that it helps us to re-examine what we know, without exactly taking a stand. We are left to make our own judgement. ",positive
"Tina Mba is a screen goddess, and here again, she proves that she deserves every accolade she gets.  There is no role she handles that I don‚Äôt believe is truly her, from her days on television, now to the big screens. She proves herself to be a true thespian.  The chemistry between Efa Iwara and Bisola Ayeola is so lovely, and when Efa switches to his comedic role is actually hilarious. I felt like he was wooing me. ",positive
"Let me start with this. The sibling rivalry between Ghana and Nigeria is still strong and I enjoy most of the light banter. Today, I stand with my Nigerian brothers and sisters and proudly claim this African jewel. I had so many reservations about this movie; a Nigerian movie hyped by Nigerians? What's new? Admittedly there were some negatives. The shouting could have been toned down but it did nothing to take me out of the immersive experience. It's a bit slow paced but that may have been necessary due to the Lego-like story building. The acting was solid however some extras were not believable in their roles. A particular scene with a security guard was not believable. However,the production was great a d light years ahead of most of the sub-par movies of African cinema. This movie is truly a great step in the right direction for Afican cinema. If it wasn't clear enough, I'm Ghanaian",positive
"A great piece of work by Kemi Adetiba, the story was well scripted, good cinematography, all actors gave a great performance. This is a world class movie... Kudos to the all the crews",positive
"Everything about the movie was well thought out, consisting of an Amazing cast who nailed their roles, an original story and top notch videography",positive
"This movie is so worth the time. I almost didn't watch it because I thought it would end up like every other Nigerian movie I had seen, but alas! I was pleasantly surprised. The storyline is unpredictable, the acting of most of the characters are believable. The picture quality is amazing! It's hands down the best Nigerian movie I've seen in recent times, and even challenges some Hollywood movies. Kudos to Kemi Adetiba on this feat.",positive
"The best Nigerian movie I've ever seen
This movie is amazing! Very creative and not predictable. I love how the story line is current and relates to what is going on in Nigeria at the moment. The acting was great - Sola Sobowale is a legend!",positive

This is one of those Nigerian movies you watch over and over and over again. Great work all through.",positive

Camera movements where on point Movie deserves every good and awesome recognition out there Production crew of King of Boys did. Great work Awesome work Kemi. You're truly the Bruce Lee of Visuals.",positive
"Unbelievable
I don't like Nigerian movies and I have never written a review on IMBD or anywhere else, but after seeing this movie yesterday, seeing it again in my dreams and waking up still thinking about it, I knew I had to write this. Very unpredictable movie, the best Nigerian movie in history. Well done Kemi Adetiba and the cast, couldn't tell that most of the actors are not so experienced when watching the movie. Well done!!",positive
"Simply the best so far
Not surprise that it is Kemi Adetiba on this one but everything about the film is the best of its kind so far in Nollywood. Of course there enough room for improvement. Cinematography was top notch but most impressive is the interpretation of the story.",positive
"Good suspense but unnecessarily long
I would rate the movie as to be a peak standard for Nigerian movies. It has its bit of suspense and great movie visuals. But still it has some unnecessary prolonged scene which were not meant to be part of the movie. Still this is a great movie for the family. Sola Sobowale is a legendary actress.",positive
"Funny, romantic film!

I went into this thinking it wouldn't be that good but I was so engrossed, the whole movie was like a ball of sunshine, it makes you laugh and smile along with the characters!",positive

This for me is way better than all the over hyped nollywood wedding party, Chief daddy and what-have-you. The humour wasn't forced, it came about naturally. Fantastic acting and great plot. Really enjoyed it.",positive

"What it means to be Nigerian

Without spoilers: This movie is a lionhearted depiction of what it means to be a decent human being who keeps trying to do what is right, despite evolving cultures, sexes, differences of opinion and the painful history of Nigeria. Without a detailed backstory as to why there is almost a millennium-old ethnic friction among over 300 Nigerian tribes in one country, this movie did an excellent job of portraying the essence of being Nigerian, being a person (male or female) and showing how the country can evolve to live in unity despite cultural differences. It is also an ode to the bond of family, roots of any culture and using the best of both international exposure with being Nigerian to create different facets of what a success story for anyone can be. It had the pleasantly surprising comedy, a fresh take on what predecessors can do for their successors and so many sublime messages touching on love, family, culture, politics, leadership, feminine strength (no nauseating feminism I promise) that can be easy to miss.

Well done Genevieve Nnaji: a movie for all to see. Kudos Naija, keep improving.",positive
"LIONHEART: A Genevieve Nnaji's Love Letter To Nigeria.

#LIONHEART: Genevieve Nnaji Sold Nigeria To The World Like a Popular Brand. A GIANT Leap.

She Took The Defunct Nigerian Home Movie Back Home To Enugu, Nigeria. That's BRAVE. It Paid off. Yes, We Can Indeed Package Nigeria To The International Market From Wherever, Be It Lagos, Enugu, Port-Harcourt, Kano, Warri, Jos, Owerri, Ibadan Or Calabar.

LIONHEART Helped In The Selling of Nigeria's Home Made Cars, INNOSON VEHICLES, @innosonvehicles To The World.

A Very NOTABLE STRIDE.

Just Like Lionheart, You Also Did Great,

Genevieve Nnaji MFR.",positive
"Wholesome and lovingly shot
Lionheart is a lovely movie that used long shots to show of the scenery quite well. If you know anything about progressive Igbo families, you know they are entrepreneurial and very family-oriented, Lionheart captured that beautifully.

It is not the typical fare in Nigerian cinema where one is guaranteed a diabolical plot full of pain, wickedness and over-acting. Lionheart is written, directed and acted by the best in class, with just the right amount of comedy thrown in, thanks to Nkem Owoh's character.

I heartily recommend.",positive
"Humbling, Heartwarming, Funny, & Empowering",positive
"Best Nollywood movie

This is not your regular Nollywood movie. This move promoted the Igbo language and culture, Innoson motors, entrepreneurial spirit. It celebrated the African girl child that all children are equal and important regardless of gender. It promoted the wisdom in African proverbs. It promoted the good deeds done to strangers.

Cinematography is great. The music score is nice. The casting was done brilliantly. Nothing over the top.

Genevieve is a national treasure. She truly deserves her national award, MFR. This movie will stand the test of time. A movie for the culture.",positive

From the ibo cultural piont of view a masterpiece. Very different from the lot. I like that some plots differed from the usual African film expectations; where you can predict what will happen next. Kudos Genny!!",positive

A very good plot, a mix of suspense and superstition, predictable until the end, with a good plot twist, good performances, in love with the works of Kunle Afolayan, who always acts in his films, in which he directs, writes and produces, multifunctional ... Adorable...",positive
"This is a story...

I beg to disagree with many of the other (negative) reviews. I believe that the movie communicated the right intensity. It's not about the book, it's about a story needing to be told. I'm a Nigerian who is closely intimidated with the war and the true story, and this film did enough to express the reality of it on many levels. I especially appreciated the live footage. I've been reading memoirs from a variety of ethnicities who were involved in the war, and this movie shows a story that is consistent with all of their stories. It's only one perspective, and fictional at that. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone interested in Nigerian history and heritage.",positive
"Great Film

I hesitated viewing the film before reading the novel. After seeing the film, I am more intrigued about the novel and the history behind it. This is a GREAT FILM, make no mistake about it.

The staff and cast did a great job in tone, symbolism and portrayal. From reading the various reviews posted here, I get a sense that many feel either a film should stick directly to the way the novel unfolds; and that's certainly not the case.

The other major point of contention seems to be that the film is meant to ""entertain"". Though a movie should hold one's attention, the main point of this film is to enlighten the viewer, while adding another layer of protection to the viewer's sensibilities.",positive
"It was Fantastic!! Ignore the negative reviews

Honestly. It was mindblowing! Didn't even believe it was shot in Nigeria, the production was special and the cast were A1. They all played thier parts well and made it fun!",positive

"A film that simply seeks to raise awareness.

Until when will we keep silent about gender sexual harassment? This film tackles this scandalous and little treated subject in a masterful way. Invites and encourages not to remain silent when you are sexually harassed, to raise your voice and not see it as something normal or something that happened because of carelessness or because someone caused it. It shows both the version of the victim and the perpetrator making it interesting. It seeks to awaken in women the awareness of raising their voices and it succeeds. It is about an international academic who is accused of sexual harassment by the best student in the class and they are taken to the school hearing to clarify things, but the situations that arise turn the case around. Quality. Entertaining Baffling. Current. Safety pin. Slightly parsimonious, they abuse the detail of developing each thing in the last situation, so the duration of 2 hours and 30 minutes. The script is interesting and smart. Some performances are at the level and others not so much. Told in two times where the present is in full screen and the past in cinema mode. A film that simply seeks to raise awareness. A powerful African drama.",positive
"NOT A FAN OF NIGERIAN MOVIES, BUT THIS ONE PLEASES

Not a fan of Nigerian movies, but this one pleases. A solid hollywood grade, eye glueing 2hrs 30mins intense ride. Graphics and vfx is visually transfixing, even though it wasn't shot with the Alexa or Miramax.. the operator behind the DSLR knows his tweaks. Audio is superb. Shot in Senegal though, set locations are amazing. The cast director selected wisely, the actors impressively reincarnate the true events back to life. Overall, its a cinematic masterpiece, hence the Netflix distribution.",positive
"Outstanding performance

Temi Otedola's performance was truly stunning. I thoroughly enjoyed the layers that the story had and the way that each key piece of information was revealed.",positive
"If it were food I would say mouth watering

The film citation is a necessity, I do not see where it would ever run out of relevance. The actors were carefully picked and displayed such professionalism, the location were amazing never new had such good universities in Senegal , the arts and craft of our African leaders carved out the African identity.

The message this movie carries, how it was told is so special, insightful and artistic. The suspense is on another level, the melange of feelings it creates to us the viewers is something else.

This movie talks about Nigeria and her politicians or politheivecians as I call them. Who are all jokers and comedians in a different area of life who decided to go into politics and toil with people's lives as much as they want entertain you on campaigns and forget what they were elected for. Big ups to the producers, actors and actresses, directors and the rest of the crew, nice movie budget especially when comparing it in the nollywood. Everything was nice but we would have loved if the movie was concluded in a way it should have been and not in suspense or another part or sequel to be released later on. Good movie especially if you are Nigerian and not interested in party or favouritism from the leaders. Just shows you the people we elect as leaders in this country are comedians who lack idea on how to rule a country. Once again big ups to everyone.",positive

Oh mehn, this movie is super funny. if you are looking for a movie to lift your mood up then this is the right movie for you.",positive
"The timing of this film must be written in the stars. It is an original twist on a themes of family/ racism / fascism. Profound moments of child craving for a family and intimacy, alongside abusive grooming. It punches you in the stomach. Kudos to the writer/director who worked tirelessly to get the project on screen an the major U.K film funders stayed away from it. He also took the project to Creative England's iFeatures but didn't make the cut... In a way, it works to the writer/directors hand to have a told a bold British story based on a True Story with Hanway films. Watch & Support playing now!",positive
"Farming is a excellent film but my god is it a tough watch

This was by far one of the best movies I have seen this year. I do not know why the rating is so bad. This movie is by far better than some of the movies that have received Oscars including Moonlight.

Farming is an extremely tough movie to watch. Every scene comes down on you... Hard enough to either make you cry out in pain, anger or just good old plain frustration. I couldn't stop cursing!",positive
"Read movie! Don't understand why this got such a low rating!
",positive
"Very disturbing but gripping

This was one of the most uncomfortable films I've watched and made me feel quite emotional. I was unfamiliar with 'farming' until this film and thank you to the writer and director for making it free to view during this time of the BLM stuggles 2020. The story drew me in and the characters were well acted and believable. The story was unrelentingly tense throughout. The ending gives no answers to the issues explored in the film but leaves the viewer to grapple with them. Very glad to have watched this and it will stay with me for a while",positive
"Sadly accurate, disturbing but incredibly engaging.

I grew up during this time period and sadly resonate with some of the issues which were brought up in this film. I have a close friend who also experienced ""farming"" and it still has repercussions in her and her family's life today. The film was sadly disturbing, but unfortunately accurate in a number of it's depictions of the era in the UK. I was shocked at the final revelation as to who Enitan is in real life, which definitely - as already explained by another reviewer - enhanced the emotional climax.

Excellent, albeit sad, but well worth watching if only for the historical context.",positive
"A fun-filled rollercoaster of emotions

If you're an open-minded, hopeless romantic, you'll definitely enjoy watching this movie. I thought that the lead characters had great chemistry and the supporting cast delivered fine performances as well. It was interesting to see the clash of cultures exposed and finally resolved amicably. There's plenty of humour, drama and tense moments to hold your interest. Certainly makes my favourite list.",positive
"An unlikely lovestory well told

Love the message of the film, and there should be many more like it: We are all people so lets not look at our differences but what unites us. Loved the chemistry between the two mean protagonists. A Bollywood movie told bj an Indian female director with a great heart for Africa/Nigeria. Respect to her for telling such a nice story. It was a bit over the top sometimes but the main premise was clear. Let's all love each other. Mock me but I winked away a few tears, hopeless romantic and big believer in cross cultural marriages that I am. Just to be clear got to know Bollywood through my wife, who is Indonesian, and discoverer Nollywood through Netflix because I loved Africa when I worked there manier year ago. Geert, a Belgian,",positive

As He is my witness, I was guided to view this awesome movie yesterday. Even though I was looking for a movie for distraction, I was compelled to watch this extraordinarily crafted movie yesterday.

"Gem of a documentary, educational, hilarious, heartfelt, basically an emotional rollercoaster

I was lucky to catch this last night playing to a full house at the London Film Week film festival on 3rd Dec 2019, competing in a select group of only seven feature-length films in official competition including Scorsese's ""The Irishman"" and the latest films by Takashi Mike, Armando Iannucci, and the already multi-award-winning Marriage Story by Noah Baumbach so my expectations were high when seeing it selected to compete in such highly esteemed company, thankfully I wasn't to be disappointed as it proved to be the best doco I've watched since ""The Dawn Wall"" (2017), though not comparable in content, I found the personal honesty truly moving and inspiring. I watch a lot of documentaries and visit a lot of film festivals as I love to discover new talent to share with my friends so I feel very privileged to be able to be the first to review this little gem. Buddy Munro (the star, entertainer, explorer, comedian and a man working his way forward in life through therapy after a deeply traumatic accident as a child) is a true force of nature. Superbly edited by Ben Hooten the film deftly intercuts between Buddy's madcap adventures in Nollywood and a deeply moving interview where we discover what made him who he is. Within minutes we cut from scenes inducing tears of laughter to ones so moving they produce tears of sadness, simply an emotional rollercoaster. This debut Directorial feature by Michael Lebor (which he also shot) has a great deal of charm, was thoroughly entertaining and I cannot recommend highly enough you taking the time to seek it out and to watch this powerful and life-affirming film, both Buddy and Michael and all involved have clearly arrived, expect to hear a lot more from this very talented group of filmmakers.",positive

"Colorful and detailing but thrilling isn't the word

Women are the focal point and Lagos is just a beauty. One could watch the movie without blinking the eye starring at what never looks like Lagos, but still is. Funny and lively, one smiles dubiously even when you are being portrayed on screen as either one of the women or few of the guys or perhaps the parents. Pity, Hatred and repetition seem to surrounds the movie as seen in Lekki Bridge; and among the women whose connections wasn't detailed much. Bandele's work is evident and he is really making a world renowned brand with Nigerian stories. In general, Fifty is standard, beautiful and lively, it is expected to be thrilling at the end but the goose in my pimples didn't show off much but I was happy remembering few lines and scenes at the end.",positive

"Nigerians in Brooklyn
Mother of George (2013) was directed by Andrew Dosunmu. It stars the lovely Danai Gurira as Adenike Balogun, newly married to Ayodele Balogun (Isaach De Bankol√©). Although the setting is Brooklyn, we're shown that the old ways brought over from Nigeria still have a profound effect on people's behavior.

The title of the movie, ""Mother of George,"" is realistic. As much as the young couple love each other, they are under the spell of George's mother, who controls many aspects of their life and their destiny.

The central plot theme is that, for whatever reason, Adenike doesn't conceive. This is never easy for any couple, but it's particularly difficult in the Nigerian culture, where a woman is supposed to conceive quickly, and often.

This is an amazing film, suspenseful, thoughtful, and colorful. We saw it at Rochester's wonderful Little Theatre. You'll lose some of the sense of the neighborhood and the costumes on the small screen, but it will work well enough to definitely be worth seeing.",positive

"Understated, powerful crime drama with historical flavor
This was a very character rich film. Not a single scene was wasted. You feel taken by the hand invisibly by the storyteller and shown things that seem unimportant perhaps or out of context at the time, yet slowly but surely build towards powerful scenes and an inescapable conclusion. You don't have to know any Nigerian history to get a sense of the buzz in the air about the country's independence which was being launched at the time this provincial crime investigation takes place. It's also worth noting that the investigation does not rely on common tropes such as what a genius the investigator but rather on an organic navigation through unfamiliar territory and peculiar characters interacting in a fluid, at times comical at times dangerous framework.",positive
"Lovely glimpse of a ground-breaking time
When I was a kid in the early 60's, I'd come down to the breakfast table and find my stepfather reading about the Congo. For a little while, it was all over the news. I don't know if the Congo occupied the news in other metropolitan areas the way it did in Detroit. It really meant something there, probably because of Detroit's large black population.

I remember as I glimpsed the blaring headlines and asked my stepfather what it all meant words like ""independence."" There was the name Patrice Lumumba and the seeming inevitability that he would be killed for his cause. The movie October 1 is set in Nigeria and does not mention Lumumba or necessarily take sides -- it is assumed everyone's for independence except possibly for the grudgingly accepting British empire forces who are still running things while planning to begin handing over power to a new Nigerian government, on Oct. 1, 1960. But the countrymen's anticipation of this ground-breaking transition is a still slightly uncertain backdrop to a detective trying to solve a string of murders and find his footing among his rulers.

I started the movie expecting it to be interestingly amateurish as have been some movies I have seen from that part of the world ... peeks into a lifestyle that no matter how nascent are little different from anyone else's. Made in Africa by Africans, the movie seemed to have grass-roots production values but then I realized that was only because they reflected the milieu. In Nigeria in 1960 people still lived very close to the land. There would be a lot of foliage and open-air buildings to be seen. I loved the fabrics out of which women made cottony dresses featuring large emblematic portraits of their leaders.

But as the movie progressed, I realized it did not suffer in production values at all; in fact, it was superior in some ways to anything I have seen coming out of the West lately. Perhaps the filmmakers did need to be creative for lack of a budget but I liked the way sometimes something, a sound, for instance, would get a special treatment, almost as if we could see the shock waves extending out on the screen. It has been a couple of months since I saw the movie and I have been wishing to write this review all that time so, please forgive me, I don't remember exactly the events being so depicted, they might have been a sound, or an emotion, or both. But I found the effects simple but evocative,

I'm not going to go into the plot other than to say that some of its turns are surprising and adult and may not be suitable for children. But I think you'll like our detective, a man of dignity and sense and who is quite thin. Whoa. He is quite appealing. Winterbottom is dashing, too -- keep an eye out for Nick Rhys. But in Inspector Danny Waziri, Sadiq Daba nails the role of a lifetime. I have to add that I think Tunde Babalola's script was brilliant, understanding so well both sides of the transitiion and knowing when to crescendo. Even though the gaining of independence is not explained like a history lesson, it is an interesting snapshot of how the countrymen responded and an intriguing context for the movie's events and the detective's courage. October 1 is a great little movie. P.S. Maybe director Kunle Afolayan would like to make one of his future projects a biography of Lumumba, if it wouldn't be too controversial. From surveying a Wikipedia entry about Lumumba, he seems to have fit my cursory childhood take on him as a tragic leader.",positive
"How NOT to do political drama

When I started watching the 'The Governor', I had hoped that, at the very least, I would learn a little about the Nigerian political system, or even just Nigeria in general, the way 'The West Wing' showed us the politics of the USA and Borgen showed us the political landscape of Denmark. I was sorely disappointed. The show follows Angela Ochello (portrayed by Caroline Chikezie) as she assumes the post of Governor of Savannah State in Nigeria after the death of her predecessor. Almost from the beginning, the show goes hopelessly wrong. IN an attempt to portray the main character as 'good', she is shown to be hopelessly naive, to the point that she is amazed at the existence of corruption in politics. This despite having been the vice-governor for several years. But that's the least of the show's problems. What is far worse is that the people producing it seem to be allergic to exposition or any form of conveying background information. After a whole season, I still have no idea what Savannah State is like. There are no panning shots, no discussion of its politics or economy. I don't even know what the main character's authority consists of! Half the time she seems to operate as a dictator, who can operate as she wants without having to acknowledge a local legislature or for that matter the national government. Perhaps people in Nigeria know all these things, but when you bring a show onto the international market, you need to educate your public. We're not going to watch the show with our computers open on the relevant wikipedia pages. Add an almost soap-like framing of the shots and acting that borders on the ridiculous, varying between the wooden and the insanely theatrical, and you end up with a mess of a show. It;s a pity, because this could have been very interesting. But as it is, it's just total amateur hour.",positive
"Worth watching

"Absolutely Stunning Picture

Incredible. Rarely do I see Nollywood movies adapted from true life situations, especially from a dated era where so much attention to detail is paid. The lighting, cinematography, props are so beautiful, this movie can definitely be categorized as modern classic. The retro feel it give is so breathtaking that nothing looks out of place throughout the 2 hour duration of the movie. Incredible casting as well! I was especially impressed by the performance of Adonijah Owiriwa who plays Captain V. M. Jaiye. Overall I loved the movie in it's entirety and hope more directors and producers can provide more movies reading between the lines of historic events. 9/10 for me.",positive

I'm a nurse in the USA and what stood out to me the most about this film was how humble and humane the doctors and medical staff were even though they were terrified of contracting ebola.

I thought this was an excellent film and the actors and actresses did an excellent job.",positive
"A great tribute to the medical staff

I just finished watching movie, during the rising of COVIT-19 pandemic. What the medical team at had gone through is happening everywhere in the world.

"Slow Burn to Brilliant
Castle & Castle takes the best of the legal service industry and showcases it exquisitely. Some of the names not just in the cast but in production show that painstaking detail has been taken to produce something realistic of an ideal legal industry in Lagos. Expect excellent production value. Acting is not our strongest forte in Nigeria, sometimes characters seem detached and untethered to the reality of their immediate situation (like having a conversation they've already had before) and in the start you may be tempted to think that is all there is to it, but if you stopped there you'd miss out on an excellent storyline that gradually draws you in. We love drama, so you'll get that, and aside for some funny scenes where the actors are struggling to not laugh themselves you start to warm quickly to the characters- Stella is a joker (a difficult character socioculturally and demographic-wise both posh and street not easy to do). I am a Litigator and I am impressed by the work put in, I was held by the storyline and I truly applaud a really impressive piece of work. Here's to excellence in the arts because this one closely imitates life. Well done guys, very well done. üëèüèæüëèüèæüëèüèæ",positive

"
Superb movie!!
This has got to be the best made movie to come out of Nigeria, not to mention hilariously funny! It seamlessly interweaves the story of two very different people - a Nigerian villager and a proper British woman - with coherence, continuity and content that most Nigerian movies lack. Each of Usuofia and Samantha has the opportunity to live in the other's domain (see part 2) and the movie does justice to the cultural difficulties experienced by each. Well worth your time.

To thoroughly enjoy this movie (and its sequel), one would have to be vaguely familiar with the Nigerian culture. Anyone however, can understand and follow what's happening.

Downside: there are relatively high variations in volume and noise levels throughout the movie making some of what is said difficult to decipher; some of the camera shots were also wacky. If you can ignore those few things, you're in for a ride!",positive

This film shows off beautiful aspects of Northern Nigeria particularly Bauchi state. I can't wait to visit with my friends. Thank you for telling a beautiful story!",positive
"Praise Jesus today because tomorrow may be too late!""

Top-tier Nigerian B-movie directed by a pastor with highlights that include the gory removal of a fetus from a pregnant woman, a prostitute paid to lick a nasty scab, a devil baby with horns, gay rape and much more. All with typically shoddy Nollywood FX, hilariously energetic acting and heavy-handed religious propaganda.

The best characters in the movie are a priest who enthusiastically spreads the word of god on the street in lengthy sequences, and a devil child (the horned baby eight years later) who crawls through the ground and terrorizes random civilians.

If you love terrible movies you must watch this at least once. The second part is worth a watch as well and features several scenes that easily outdo this chapter in terms of sheer insanity. Unfortunately, it features too many boring sermons and prayer scenes, and a new pastor who lacks the entertaining energy of the previous. Watching relatively normal sermons isn't as funny as watching a priest yell about God in a bar and bothering all the customers. Shame.

This one however gets my full recommendation.",positive

With a small budget this film deserve a very good critic.Finally a film with a gay theme without a tragedy. One moving story, with good actors.I recognize problems with edition, and other small Technics problems.But who care about this, when we see a film so full of truth and tenderness??? Sometimes I ask me why films about gay man are sad,dramatic? Why can we have a film with gay thematic without hope? Some scenes for me were really sublime. The story is very sensitive, principally because the plot is about black, gay and poor people. I would like to see more films like this: simple, direct, full of truth, one real story.This story can happen.",positive
"Great film - entertained and educated

W Sharpe Director of New Media, Public Broadcasting Atlanta ¬ñ 30th July 2007 ""I recently saw the film Rag Tag during the National Black Arts Festival in Atlanta. I thought it was a bold, daring, provocative film. I was surprised at the reaction of some of the viewers of the film and their objection to the subject matter.

I think that the Arts Festival is exactly the place to exhibit such works. It is a place for artists to exhibit their craft and enlighten to public through their art. Please do not censor future content. I have learnt many things through the films presented at the Arts Festival and it would be a shame if the narrow minded views of a few stifled lifelong learning. 

The film has been a topic of discussion among the friends I brought with me to screen the film and those who were not in attendance. I'd like to know if the film is in release on DVD or will be screened at any other festivals around the country."" 

C Anderson - 8th and 10th August, 2007 ""I just saw Rag Tag at the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Film Festival. It was Great. I felt that the audience at the showing I attended really responded positively to the film (and it was a full house)¬Ö. The accents were certainly present, but they were by no means a hindrance. I am probably more challenged by a strong southern accent from the USA - and that's in my own country!",positive
"On the 1st of August, a graduation party brings more than anyone expected.

The film is a suburban drama that examines how a family manages to survive its past, and how that past is inextricably entwined with their future. 

During a graduation party, the estranged father, Dipo, returns. Each family member deals with his return differently, and thus we see how they must have survived his initial departure. As we learn the reasons for his departure and the reasons for his return, our sympathies shift.

The film is well acted and the story unfolds itself smoothly and naturally, without resorting to exposition. It is refreshing to see a dramatic film about African Americans that veers from stereotypes.",positive

A well crafted story and an excellent addition to the new Nollywood wave. Gradually the movie reveals itself to be an allegory on taking risks and the journey to self discovery.

"A must watch!

One word describes this movie, BRILLIANT!!! From beginning to end, the hairs on the back of my neck couldn't stop standing. The story line was simple yet captivating, the acting was bang on and flawless. The delivery of the movie was done with such ease and humor that I secretly wished it wouldn't end. Mary is a sweet girl that any man would gladly ""take home to mama"" (kinda made me wonder how she was still single). While Akin is your archer-type male, whom I suspected had a wicked sense of humor. The character of the twins and Mary's sister provided an appropriate dose of comic relief. I must admit I am extremely proud of the cast and crew, Nigeria was highlighted as a pleasant place to be. I will definitely be getting the DVD when it comes out. PHONE SWAP has proved to be a must see classic of our time.",positive
"Love this Film

I just saw this film last night at the AFI film fest and it deeply had a profound effect on me. I will enjoy watching it for many years to come and the conversations that it will spark. It features engaging performances by the entire cast about how a modern Nigerian woman is pressured by her family to produce a male heir. Shot in the Igbo language with English subtitles, the film works on many levels including the timing, and pauses. The acting is very natural without melodrama and it feels very believable. Overall, the film was riveting and kept me really engaged. 

Shot in about a two-week time period, filmmaker, Chika Anadu soars in her first feature film, which presents a critique and glance on Igbo cultural traditions and discriminatory preferences for males. It's too bad that we won't see new film releases from this filmmaker for a while, as she plans to take a break and make commercials for a bit.",positive

"Amazing work of art!

Doctor Lanre will leave you glued to your seat all through. Great story, amazing cast, fantastic rendition of lines and suspense filled. The story is so unique, a diversion from the regular Nollywood love story. I look forward to more intriguing stories from the writer. I will definitely recommend that you see this.",positive
"A Good and Wise film. It was a good film, that shows the dangers of Nigerian tribalism and how it can affect a young love. I am glad that it did not descend into stereotypes (too much), as both Yoruba and Igbo tribes were portrayed as dignified and with a lot of love for their children. The only two things I would have loved for them to do is to make the police tip have been anonymous, rather than arresting the Igbo father.

Both fathers should have had to live with the guilt of ruining their children's lives, and thus their own. No additional punishment would have been necessary. Also, they should have delved deeper into the wickedness of the Yoruba witchcraft tradition. That juju should have been shown as the direct cause of Stella's death.

I hope that Nigerian films continue to get better and develop this way. I am in the film industry in America and want to bring our culture to the world stage!",positive
"An excellent short documentary

Warning: Spoilers
Blood rider was an excellent short film following the high-stakes career Joseph takes on as a blood rider. The stakes are raised further as someone close to Joseph is hospitalizes suddenly and is in need of blood at short notice.

Having said that, s/he definitely had a lot of good to work with. From production to story-telling, it's exquisiteness all the way. In fact, the acting is so genuine, it is perplexing. Even the extras deserve Oscars. Beautiful. Just so damn beautiful.

The energy here is a rush. It will make you feel like you are in court. So forget the trailer's portrayal: 'Charge & Bail' is no ordinary comedy. It is serious business. Asides its banging editing, an intricately woven story & an excellent closing make it -a story of many bests- we have seen in Nollywood in a very very, very long time.

One shouldn't miss this. Especially writers, producers & ALL practitioners in Nollywood. Because 'Charge & Bail' is a standout. It's nothing like your usual Nollywood comedy. If it's a comedy at all, it's a comedy for intelligent people. One that makes bursting into laughter, a result of your brain being tickled. Exceptional. üèÜ",positive
"Super Recommended! 'Gold Statue' is Magnificent Excellence. It promises a mountain of fun. And with that mountain, comes rivers of quality and an avalanche of Perfect acting performances. This movie is worth every penny you will spend and more. So much more; it practically tore the screening hall to pieces. This is Gold!

A thirty-something strong audience was held spell bound from start to finish. And that is a Very Big something considering 'Gold Statue' runs for a mighty two hours and twenty five minutes. But forget the longevity- Trust us you want to see this movie. It is two hours and twenty five minutes of starchy undiluted fun. And that fun doesn't come unaccompanied.

Rather, it comes distinguished by top of the line quality in every single area. The amount of sheer effort to deliver pristine quality is indescribable. You have to see it. For Nollywood; it is Amazing. Acting is a hundred. Make-up a hundred. CGI a hundred. Props a hundred and fifty. And the story?

That one is just Mad. Literally. Dictionary-Ly. Mad! PS: Whoever did the make-up for a post-lynched Gabriel Afolayan in the opening scene deserves a gold medal. To that make-up artist; we say Bravo! We honour you.

I wouldn't even take a bathroom break, I almost wet myself! I forgot I could pause the movie and return.

Ms Adetibe assuaged a thirst I had always longed for: Nigeria in all its realness. Politics, religion, poverty, wealth, God-fatherism, entitlement mentality, corruption and then HOPE. Hope in the Nigeria embodied in the person of Officer Gobir. The cast even makes me more proud - all indigenous!

KOB is Number 1 Nollywood movie to me right now.The story is way different and genuine.Unveils what goes on in politics for real.I highly applaud the thought process of the script writer and director plus every single cast brought on their A game.I can't even fault the movie.GOD BLESS KEMI,positive

shophallowaynorth22 February 2021
I finally came across this movie via Netflix. I know that it no longer qualifies as a new release and that is the misfortune for so many films created on the international stage---once they are able to be consumed by mainstream audieces state-side, they are no longer the ""new hotness"".

As an Black American (our viewership and support of films has been known to offer legendary box office results stateside and internationally), I have to say that this film brings Nigerian films into the here and now with great production and a storyline which while not Academy Awards level (very few movies actually are which is why it remains the peak of performance standards for an international community), it is CERTAINLY in the category of iconic cult gangster classics such as ""Scarface"" or ""The Godfather"".

In fact, I was trying to consider when exactly a film which placed a woman as a kingpin in the front and center of the story had been done in American cinema...and unfortunately despite America's heavy feminist and womanist presence, I came up empty. Such films are simply not being made nor have they been made for consumption in the U.S. or in actually any international film industry.

Yes, we have had some amazing series produced interestingly enough by streaming services such as Netflix on the international stage, most notably the Mexican cartel focused ""Queen of the South"". However a feature film? Ms. Adetiba has the honor of being the first to really attempt such an endeavor and have it come off so successfully with such nuance.

The actress who played the main character Ms. Sola Sobowale? What a treat! She was amazing in her role! I understand that many here have derided the ""wailing"", unfortunately all of whom are seemingly Nigerians who perhaps are more so insecure about their own culture being ""exposed' however I was not put off by it in anyway and neither were the other Americans who watched the film with me. We called it damned good acting in fact.

As someone who quotes scenes from films such as ""Scarface""--a film in which one could also deride Al Pacino's performance as Tony Montana as being over the top and verging on histrionic, such emotional excesses instead become appropriate to the film genre and the individual characters who of course did not reach the top of a shadow economy by being conservative and reserved wallflowers. They're flashy like their materialistic excesses and dark crimes...and that's why such characters work, taking over our minds long after the film has ended becoming icons within our brains.

One should not be ashamed of the cultural nuances of this film anymore someone Italian should be ashamed of the cultural nuances put on display by Francis Ford Coppola in the Godfather. It becomes a part of the charm and Ms. Adetiba knows just how to display such with subtlety and reserved nuance.

The character is bold and over the top as she should be, but Ms. Adetiba knows how to operate with directorial constraint. Kudos!

Let me wrap it up by saying that I as a born in America, reared by Americans, non-Nigerian very educated individual who maintains an international fluidity in my experiences and perspective LOVED this film. Thank you Ms.Adetiba for giving the world an amazing female iconic character. Thank Ms. Sobowale for bringing an effervescent and believable life to the character that solidified this film as one of my favorites. To paraphrase the line of one of our most iconic cult characters in African American culture-----""Alhaji, she's a bad muth--shut yo' mouth!""

I will recommend it highly to all whom I know.

Quite interesting Well Its about a Chicago gang star and one ex army general in Nigeria in the reverse. But all that is now gone as we know more.,positive
"Salute to Kemi Adetiba and everyone who worked on this great movie.
This is by far the best movie to come out of Naija in a long time, the storyline, yes, especially the storyline, it is the bomb. These days, most naija movies just flaunt fine bodies, expensive houses n cars, cash, I guess to make up for the lack of depth or not so easy to follow stories, you just watch n make excuses n shrug as you watch, we gat to support our own, but this king of boys, damn! It has everything, they gave us fine cars, houses, faces, skin, everything to make us feel good and we still got great acting n a superb story.. I just can't get over the story... Please everyone should watch it and tell others about it too, it will be a great way to encourage the great mind that this came out of to bring forth more so we will keep having sensible, meaningful, worldclass movies come out of naija.

"A wonderful film experience! Substantial storyline.

King Of Boys was not ""just another"" recent nollywood film with only great cinematic quality whereas lacking substance in the plot. The storyline had depth and highlighted the present ongoing issues in Nigeria, addressing the difficulties in trying to be ""honest"" in a society standing on the foundation of corruption and it exposed the ""dirty-games"" within Nigerian politics.

The actors took their time to display realistic emotions and the dialogue was realistic as well. The entire production quality of the movie was great!

The suspense would keep you on your toes, and the comic relief would make you chuckle. It is definitely worthwhile.",positive

Kemi Adetiba is a Brilliant Producer. King of Boys is a must watch. I love the drama and suspend. I even had to look up on line who wrote the script because I suspected the person was from the street and wow it was Kemi. Good work mama.",positive
"I'm blown...and still reeling from the story and production.
I had watched the trailer, but it was 1/20th what the movie was. I heard Aunty Kemi promoting the movie on radio, but I had no idea. Aunty Kemi has upped the game when it comes to stories and production. You see, this movie blends the 3 major languages in Nigeria (ah well 4, plus English) beautifully...It almost didn't feel like a movie anymore! I expected the story to deflate at some point, buy boy o boy...it was full up until the end. The cast did a brilliant job...the lead was on fire! Kai...a must watch!",positive

Had the opportunity of viewing this movie at the Oakland Film Festival and exceeded my expectation. It is very entertaining and kept my eyes glued to the screen. It has great humor.

spicybeachgirl15 February 2021
My top 5 Movies in Descending order 1. Lara and the Beats 2. The Devil Wears Prada 3. Meet Joe Black 4. Coming to America 5. Bridesmaids

I am from the states, and I'm a HUGE happily addicted Afrobeats fan. So the music for me, especially the perfect placements for the scenes, was the sweetess cherry on top of my absolute favorite movie. Oh my God where do I start. The opening shot making a HUGE statement without saying a word makes this movie something every African American should see. Loved this movie MUCH more than the movie about a ficticuous African country that doesn't exist. This was hands down 100 times better set in a beautiful city in an African country that is actually REAL. As real as the chemistry between Lara and Sal. Much appreciated the drool worthy eye candy BTW, yummy! This Nigerian Slum Dog, well in this case Billionaire, was robbed of all of it's glory, due to a heaping flavorless serving of heavily promoted Disney white rice trying to pass itself off as Jollof with food coloring. Lara and the Beats was the authenic soul nurturing plate of REAL Jollof with plantains, smiles, and love. Hopefully now it will become viral on the small screen, and get all of the accolates it deserves. A must see multiple times.",positive

"Wow! Netflix finally picked up something good.

Out of Nigeria from writer/producer Genevieve Nnaji, comes this sweet little gem. In a recycled and regurgitated superhero and action/cgi animation morass that Hollywood has turned into, this is a much needed diversion. Are you tired of sequel after sequel and prequel (laughable word) after prequel? Are you tired of seeing the same boring plot lines hashed over and over and, oh yes, over again? Fear not, here comes LIONHEART to the rescue. Its title fits the story. Nnaji put her whole heart into making this a genuinely beautiful piece. I started watching and was actually waiting for the movie to drop the ball. It never did. It does have a minor bit of suspense on how the story will play out. It touches rather lightheartedly, with a touch of humor, on the corruption in politics and money in eastern Africa without throwing it in your face. It ends rather nicely with a ""possible maybe"" of something more after the credits roll. It shows people that you don't have to have a billion dollar budget with all the best FX and top dollar actors hectic paced movie (that mirrors most people's lives these day), but that you can have your light and breezy lazy afternoon stress free movie (this one being without any possible way it could even get close to PG-13), and really feel good during and after watching. I think the only reason this got a PG because they showed girls in swimsuits by a pool, and maybe, just because no one is going ro take a G movie serious. Unless you have the moral compass of the creator of Playboy and Penthouse, this is a good one to get into on a cold and wet Saturday afternoon, watching with the family and relaxing by the warm glow of a fireplace.",positive

"A New Chapter in Nollywood

I honestly don't understand those who gave this movie a low rating. I don't typically write movie reviews, but I felt compelled to rate this one because it appears that a whole bunch of viewers aren't pleased with how Genevieve Nnaji in her directing debut managed to sell her movie to Netflix (a Nigeria first) and open in Toronto film festival.

For starters this is a Nollywood movie like no other. The cinematography is great, the makeup and costumes are great, the sound is much better than the mainstream, the acting is good, the story, though simple, is typical of what goes on in Nigeria, without any typical nollywood caricaturistic exaggeration (the screaming, the loudness, the trying hard to be funny or dramatic, etc.), and the duration of 90 minutes is just right. This movie is a genuine, realistic, and subtle introduction of the Igbo community of Nigeria to the world.

Lionheart is not just a good movie that made a dent in a rusty and stagnant Nollywood industry, this is a new beginning from which the young upcoming Nigerian filmmakers and actors know it is possible to put Nigeria on the global map of film.

I'd give this movie an 8, but to counteract the unfair low ratings of the haters and to appreciate the boldness of Genevieve's debut as a director, I am giving this movie a well deserved 10.",positive

Lionheart is a creative gift, a joyous feet of cast ensemble, potent storyline and qualitative production. From the beautiful lead character, Genevieve Nnaji to Nkem Owoh, we feel the lives of people who maybe different from us,share a unifying tie. Our contemporary reality in Nigeria and around the world is portrayed with grace, emotions and style in this film.

Lionheart isn't driven by noise nor quick flash scenes of hysteria, rather it solidly maps our humanity and individual response to lose, betrayal, courage and greed. This is a film that everyone will easily connect with. It is an honest human story of family love and value, ethnicity, and the underrated power of women in our society.

The comedy is timely, the story is uniquely told. This is Nollywood's finest film. The beauty of art is when every relevant details of the lives of people strikes us with empathy, truth and joy. Lionheart will make you feel empathetic, it's comical scenes will suffuse you with joy and laughter, and the deeper messages subtly and overtly told will reveal the common truth on responsibility, family love, united efforts and the beauty of our diversity. Any art that seek attention is vain art and Lionheart dispels fleeting interest. It's an immersive tale like never seen before. Watch and attest. 100% original film.",positive

This movie tells a story about culture, unity and family. So many themes that I can't finish mentioning. Genny's directing skills, acting skills and the cinematography, cast, crew.., everything was top notch.

"Great Movie from Nollywood.

Lionheart wasn't just written for the sake of it. It portrayed so many things going on in Nigeria that it'll take one with in-depth and an open mind to see through the movie. The opening scene corrects the fact that dialogue is a better solution to solving problems other than chaos. The veterans showed why they are called veterans. Pete Edochie gave the movie the maturity it has. Nkem Owoh aka Osuofia relaxed the mood of the film. Onyeka Onwenu was spectacular in her role as mother and her spoken Igbo sounded like she's singing. Kanayo O Kanayo the supposed villain gave a great performance as well. Phyno's music at the end gave the movie a perfect ending. All the stereotypes of Nollywood were shattered in the movie and I love the fact that Lagos wasn't used as it created room to showcase other great States of Nigeria. Genevieve tactically did all these. She knew exactly what she wanted to achieve with the movie and I think she achieved it. The movie is just a reminder to Nigerians and the entire world that with investment in Nigerian entertainment industry,we can create a better content that doesn't necessarily loose the essence of what makes us Nigerians. The story might not be to intriguing for some but it sure sent out a loud but subtle message that there are so many potentials lying around in Nigeria. Should I even mention the made in Nigeria Innoson (IVM) Motors used in the movie? Genevieve was actually born to do this and she's doing it effortlessly.",positive

"A Brilliant Series From Nigeria!!!
I am so happy I came across this series. I enjoyed it thoroughly from the beginning to the end. I hope there will be a season two.

My family loves to watch Nigerian films, but I often find the production rather poor, and I was often put off by the obsession with Christianity and the tendency to demonize traditional Nigerian spirituality. But this series cast a fair balance. Yes, religion is a big part of Nigerians' life, but so too are many other things, and the creators of this series gave us a glimpse of the huge potential Nollywood holds because this series actually rivals many similar films coming out of Hollywood.

The writing and directing were on point, the actors were superb: the lead actor, Sola Sobowale, was unbelievable brilliant. I also love the costume. Another thing to mention is the many Nigerian proverbs shared throughout the episodes. I didn't know Nigerians have so many wise sayings. They gave the writing/drama a strong boost.",positive
"Absolutely sensational

This made me feel proud to be Nigerian. The acting, production and sheer expertise of this 7-part sequel left me giving a standing ovation. Nollywood really has come far. Storyline aside, the performances from each character were phenomenal and really captured my attention. I wish Oscars could be given for Eniola Salami actress and Toni Tones (young Eniola). I think I went through every emotion - I cried, I laughed, I gasped, I got goosebumps and I was in awe.

The storyline was brilliant and I didn't see IT coming!!!

My hat goes off to Kemi A for writing and directing this masterpiece. The fact that I could easily watch tbis again says a lot.",positive
"This Is The Best Political Series In Africa

Let me start by saying kudos to every new members that made this outstanding political series possible

I'm a solute everyone and I must also encourage the producers to keep up the good work we need more of this

This shows the concept of politics, details everything is all about interest and no one is anyone's enemy until they are enemies

Living in Bondage the film that marked the start of Nollywood. It is a story of love, betrayal, suffering and redemption. The motifs of God and Satan plays a central roll in this film. Andy, played by Kenneth Okonkwo, makes a faustian bargain early on in the film. And his material gains is mirrors by his psychological loss. This duality of the material realm mirror the duality of the spiritual realm as there is no rest for the wicked. I walked out of the theater strong in faith.

I'm very impressed by the movie, the story, the acting and the delivery. I was waiting to be disappointed, because of the poor review but I didn't get that. I'm a lover of classical movies and this movie is definitely pass the bar. Every scene tells a story. I love that. If could have ended in any scene and still had a beautiful ending like it did. Yes, it's that good and educational.",positive
"Best movie in 2021 so far
Though I didn't really understand the yoruba parts but I really enjoyed the part I did understand, as a guy who belongs to the new generation this movie gives an enlightenment on what it looks like during the 80's, a period we never met, our parents described it for us but this movie showed it to us, the acting was also so engaging, I felt like I was a part of the movie, thank you so much and I wish for more of these movies.",positive
Compelling story,positive
"This was nice and long but worth it
IMo, I thought this thing was very well put together. I loved the way they used the flashbacks in court from the protagonist's perspective to unfold the truth , so there was no paraphrasing in the throes of recalling unreliable memories.

It just worked, I also loved that I got to experience through the film another culture and it was nice and sweet and all the ancillary characters added a lot to the story.

And I loved the antagonist how his huge ego got in the way of a functional life for him , really cool! It was all explained and well-thought out. Loved it!

Way to go Netflix, this deserves a lot praise.",positive

The Director and the producers did amazing work on this movie.",positive

The movie address a topic that is very fundamental in Nigeria Education system. Good story line, interesting plot, fantastic acting. Well done Temi. You were believable..

Every movie from Kunle Afolayan is always a story we can all generally relate with. The storyline, natural acting , great casting is always something to watch out for.

The movie is a wonderful delivery of the sexual assaults on university female student by some lecturer. It passes the message in a simple unsuspecting manner. Unpredictable end however, a few forgivable misses",positive
"Absolutely Splendid diving into a decade long issue of harassment by Lecturers
Please more of this meaningful content. Not movies focused on Lekki and oil money lifestyles. Yes some things might have been better but it gets a 10 from me because this is the type of content i love to see come out of nollywood.

Such a wonderful movie! From beginning to end it has you laughing, smiling, and crying. It really goes to show God's love and power even in our darkest and ""Last Days.""

"This film is absolutely brilliant!

I'm going to keep this short... This film was excruciatingly painful to watch but it's portrayed brilliantly by everyone involved. This is a true story, much like the short film, ""Black Sheep,"" also based on the same premise, and again, is a true story. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje done a phenomenal job crafting this harrowing, despicable masterpiece",positive

Best Skinhead Cultural movie done in years...if you like movies like Romper Stomper, This is England, A Clockwork Orange...you will probably like this and if you like well made dramas also.... actors first movie produce and from peronal experience too....exellent work mate....loved it...so sad that people down grade this masterpiece in art form from a personal view, from a rookie of making movies... enjoy folks....",positive

"Don't listen to this negative feedback

Ive noticed some people can't handle the truth so they have to make up lies this is a great film not everything is true in the film but Adewale has said that but the old Tilbury skins are just jealous .... Take the film for what it is and understand life was bad in the 70s 80s for a lot of people enjoy the film and don't listen to this bad criticism.",positive
"GREAT MOVIE: The very best this year 2020.

The characters were real and brutally compelling. The idea that the skin head gang weren't portrayed in true light is flawed and in no way detracts from how good this movie really is. Dramatization as a function of theater was a bit exaggerated or twisted to buttress the rawness of the story and that's excusable. Plus Genevieve Nnaji and Gugu were fun to watch. This movie deserves an Oscar.",positive
"So relatable for Africans in the diaspora

Spoke to my own experience if being a African not living in Africa and trying so desperately to find belonging in a new home. Fantastic film!",positive
"Wow, this true story! Wow! Amazing!

Wow this story! The many many many stories of the Black experience throughout the African diaspora, and throughout generations. I am so glad our Brotha shared his story and got to write, direct, star in. And Damson wow, his acting is always amazing.

Stories that need to be told. Our stories. Stories that people wouldn't even believe if they were told. Amazing work.",positive
"People will never learn if they don't even try.

All the reviews here that are negative are simply negative because you are finding reasons not to like the movie. This movie tackles so many issues including the biggest one of all. Identity Crisis in Black men. If you're using the skinheads as an excuse not to like the movie then I'm sorry but you my friend are ignorant. There are hundreds maybe even thousands of movies where the black pimp or the black guy story is never told. No one complained about these movies and some of them are the best movies of today. To like this movie you mustn't be ignorant and blinded by such things. Because you wouldn't complain if this was a story of yours. This is a huge issue and a beautiful story that people should be open to hearing",positive
"Great film

I worked on this film. I don't normally watch films I've worked on but this was amazing top man ade John",positive
"Story line on point

Really love the drama, suspense and how the Nigerian culture was portrayed. It flowed really good. Genevieve Nnaji was really spectacular. The court proceedings was very realistic. Not sure why the previous reviewer gave it a 6star. Must have had a bad day. Really enjoyed every bit. Good job team.",positive
"Beautiful movie depicting historic events in Benin kingdom

This movie was very educational and interesting to watch. I am still in shock it was done in 2014. The acting and directing was superb. Some reviews that heavily criticised this work seem racist and angry the white men were portrayed as wicked people.

Kudos to the cast and crew.",positive
"Well the movie is bad, but...

Well the movie is bad, but the story kept me watching until the end, which a I cannot say for a lot of new big production movies. Acting is bad, the production is bad, but despite of its floss I like it. It's 2 hours of my life which I did not regret spending.",positive

"Better than Bollywood!

I don't know on what basis people have given this movie such a low rating but believe me after a long time I've a watched such a good, cute, clean and better than Bollywood movie. Good job Nollywood. Keep it up. It gets 10/10 from me.",positive
"Heartwarming, good natured film

Appreciated the message about the universality of love and the way the film goes on to show the value of the protagonist in a professional, moral capacity as well as a her beauty. There were funny characters, and overall it was a feel-good, uplifting film. It would benefit from more screen time of the central couple but this was to flesh out the side plot and give time to the other family dynamics, so overall not a bad shift in the balance.",positive
"More than the synopsis

My first Nigerian Drama, this drama is more than a different race movie. The movie also dealt with the abuse that women face even though it was suppose to be a side note. The message came out clear and concise. Absolutely loved this drama.",positive
"GOD is calling...

Thank you for a perfect example of how HE works in our lives: This movie is a gut-wrencher, reminding us how He works through imperfect, repentant people who are only called to obey Him. He does the rest. He is faithful to complete what He has started. What a GOD honoring movie, showing the Triune in goodness and glory and power. Thank you.",positive
"Very uplifting

I knew about this movie in 2018 but didn't watch it. I somehow stumbled upon it few days ago from 22 Dec, 2020 and started glued to it. It was a 2hours movie that I rather shouldn't call entertainment but a moment of empowerment. If I was having doubts, my conviction got better... I was able to connect with the movie because obviously, I have experienced a touch of God before.

I say ""yes"" again to God's call.",positive

The movie has a lot of moral lessons. Great role interpretation by Zainab Balogun. If you have lost your way, this movie all you need to re-direct your path to God.",positive
"Saw the Premiere in Houston Texas

This movie should win an Oscar Award. The Storyline is so good. The Actors were all incredible, Vivica Fox, Kim B, Mickey R, and the Nigerians were just so excellent.

Seeing the effect of Oil pollution, and the poverty in the Oil producing regions, The corruption of Government officials, the huge influence the Oil majors have on the politicians, all of these were an eye opener, that the movie have so cleverly managed to bring to life, whilst keeping the entertainment value, it is short of a documentary. Really really engaging and educative.

It reminds one of 'Blood Diamond', I hope the world will receive it well, and it will help bring an end to the disaster as it currently stands, for the poor people of the Niger Delta.",positive
"THE BEST MOVIE. EVER.

Things Fall Apart is the BEST movie ever. Even better than The Force Awakens. It should have won at least 5 Oscars. Okonkwo is the sexiest man I've ever seen, and everyone I've met who have seen him desire him.",positive

"Maybe the best movie to come out of Africa in a good while!

I cannot believe no one i know hasn't watched this, it should be considered the Citizen Cane of African movies! You see Baby Police is GROUND breaking for it's time being, it's almost REVOLUTIONARY not only in terms of filmography but in terms of poetry, music, video games and humanity ITSELF! The story is based on a baby, that might in fact be one of the smartest babies alive, in fact i enjoy comparing this movie to Baby Geniuses by Bob Clark, of course this is a unfair comparison... Baby Police wins obviously by a MILE! Dada is so smart he can outsmart the entire village he habitats! He's enjoys playing pranks on inferior people than him and he knows how to survive in the cruel world of Africa by stealing TVs and tricking several other people all to survive the African Mecha Wars. A Truly beautiful struggle if i say myself, there where scenes of him that brang me to tears of how strong a baby can be! In fact this movie should be shown to all the babies considering i believe it would increase the brain size of a human TEN FOLD, thus making the human race evolve more and MORE! As the title says, he does become a Police in the last minutes (this shouldn't be a spoiler due to the fact that the title already gives away the entire plot) and later on has to do Police stuff due to a punishment, this struggle of him and the police also brang me to tears because he couldn't smoke weed while in front of the police force and that really is something PRETTY worrying! The dialog in this movie is as good as filmography gets, they are so emotional and symbolic and in my opinion this movie may be the most quotable movie of all times. Phrases such as ""You are the No."" and ""God Speed, Bring the Weed."" are always to be kept in my heart for it has helped me confront my fears in life. 

For me Baby Police was like being a starving baby in Africa later to be feed the most delicious and tummy-fulling dish of all the planet cooked by Gordon Ramsay! Needles to say, it didn't also save me from dying but it made happy with the most delicious thing i ever ate. I totally recommend this movie for people who grandma's are dying and have a sense of culture in there hearts.",positive
"Painstakingly conceived and teeming with raw, unbridled energy, Eyimofe offers a sumptuous, keen-eyed look at modern Lagosian life.",positive
"Excellent Realistic Drama

The story excellently showcase Nigerians realities. Message worthy of the efforts put into it. Excellent casting! & you will surely love the ending.",positive
"Powerful and deeply human film

""Eyimofe"" focuses on the hopes, desires and struggles of ordinary Lagosians, forced to daily confront a bleak world ruled by money and largely desensitized to human suffering.

It depicts the lives and problems of its main characters, Mofe and Rosa, with gritty realism and in a very engrossing way, with some unexpected plot twists and without a moment of boredom. The stories of the two protagonists are brilliantly and poignantly interwoven. The movie also renders the atmosphere of Lagos so compellingly that one feels literally transported to the city.

Mofe's inner strength, integrity, quiet dignity and stoicism are profoundly moving, though he is seemingly a man like millions of others. And one can't help being enthralled by the proud Rosa's attempts to change her and her sister's life for the better.

All the characters in the film seem very authentic - and often as inscrutable as real-life humans. Many of the characters elude any attempts at a simplistic classification into good people and villains, though it is clear that the most powerful ones are also the most ruthless and the most callous.

To me, the most fascinating and admirable character - apart from Mofe - was the landlord Vincent. It is easy to misjudge him, but his humanity touched me on a very deep level. Thanks to characters like him the heart-warming possibility of hope and solidarity always remains present in this film. This is a very beautiful and thought-provoking movie which I can highly recommend to everyone.",positive

"Good African Soap Opera. Two Thumbs Up

14 May 2020: Last year 2019, I started watching movies and television shows made in Africa, mainly Nigeria and Kenya. I would like to see the ""Fifty"" soap opera run for many years like American soap opera dramas. I like every episode.

Since I was born and lived in USA my entire life watching American movies and t.v show, I am Not use to seeing an All African (black) cast in soap opera dramas, but it is a real nice change of pace and the African actors/actresses are just as talented as their counterparts in North America. I really enjoyed watching pretty and talented African actresses Dakore Agbuson, Adesua Etomi and the so beautiful and talented, Pearl Thusi and the male actors are good too, Chris Attoh and other. Go Nollywood go.",positive
"Thrilling to watch!

If you are Nigerian, then you will understand that this movie is not a clich√©, the plot twist was fantastic. This movie moved from the usual Nigerian romcom and focused on suspense which was thrilling to watch and had me glued to the screen from beginning to the end! Well done to the actors, a great job, indeed!",positive

There were no words minced and no truth, decorated falsely. This teaches a whole lot of message and exposure to the human trafficking world! Plus Sharon Ooja is such an exceptional actress.",positive

"A Major Step in taking back our narrative

This movie, has really showed a deep side of the struggles of the people we often ignore. Easy to see a person to judge, but when stories like these are told you start to look at everyone with a different lens. The ending, though abrupt keeps you in a limbo and holds you in a powerful suspense pondering on what you just witnessed.

A win for Mo Abudu and Director, Gyang",positive

This is my 3rd Nollywood movie and I am shocked. Really true, disturbing, unsettling. Some people are writting comments about the ending the cinematography etc, what did you expect? These real life subjects do not have a happy ending and no script. If you wish to see something easy and comforting you should look somewhere else.....",positive

"A Modern Nigerian Classic‚ö°

I am not Nigerian this lifetime, but I felt empowered by this INCREDIBLE 'Tour de force' eruption, if u will, of the nefarious exposure of British colonialism, pedophile plagued Roman Catholic Church, insane various tribal prejudices exposed galore & a truly decent Muslim Nigerian from the north detective tasked to quickly make sense of several horrible rapes & murders of tribal virgins in a southern small town - that began 6 weeks before October 1st, 1960 - the day of Nigeria's independence from the British.

Nollywood truly has a political/religious/tribal gem here for those who seek to broaden their perceptions of the whys of the major ills of the world & in this case a small community in Nigeria - r so pervasive today.

Soul comes to this physical reality for experiences & this film delivers a ton of them‚ù§",positive

"A must watch for younger Nigerians and general lovers of a good film.
olawal-894-63752326 December 2016
After having this in My List on Netflix for probably a year, I finally decided to watch it, being a skeptic of all films made in Nigerian. I hate Nollywood and their repetitive nonsense films about love, in laws and general foolishness about money. And don't get me started with the bad camera work and sound/sound effects. Enter October 1st, the films is simply everything I wanted plus more. A good detective film, a love story without too much emphasis on the love, a country's last journey through independence from the white man and the very good play on the stereotype of the different tribes that makes up the Fedral Republic of Nigeria. I spent the first 10 years of my life there and still have and love the vivid memory's however often forget, lest I am reminded by films like this. Culture, language, food, palm wine and of course the British. The film was well acted, very well directed, you knew who the perpetrator is from the get go, but due to everything that made up the rest of the film, I didn't care that it took a while to get to him. It also had plenty of Yoruba spoken in it which is my first language, so this is one I will be recommending to all my fellow Nigerians. I will be looking out for more work by Kunle Afolayan. Well done!!!",positive
"Captivating and compelling!

Compelling and captivating! Beautiful colors and powerful performances. Camera angles invite you into every scene till the very end. Bravo for first shot!",positive
"One of the best nollywood movie

I really enjoyed the movie, i now know why it's is considered as the first ground breaking nollywood movie",positive
"Seminal Movie in Nigerian Cinematic History

Living in Bondage the film that marked the start of Nollywood. It is a story of love, betrayal, suffering and redemption. The motifs of God and Satan plays a central roll in this film. Andy, played by Kenneth Okonkwo, makes a faustian bargain early on in the film. And his material gains is mirrors by his psychological loss. This duality of the material realm mirror the duality of the spiritual realm as there is no rest for the wicked. I walked out of the theater strong in faith. And faith in Nigeria is what I have now.",positive
"Really Good Movie
This is probably the best Nigerian movie I've ever seen. Definitely a class above your usual light Nollywood stuff. Characters and plot were well developed and realistic. Noah and Dominic were really great in their acting.

And the movie props! I am sooo impressed! The ancient vehicles (404), appropriate hairstyles and attire and house decor. The producers and directors did their homework. It took me down memory lane. The movie was intense throughout, I couldn't even pause until the movie ended! Bravo!

At last a Nigerian movie that keeps viewers at the edge of their seats and was not predictable. Well done to those behind the effort.",positive
"Absolutely love it!

I'm usually not psyched about watching Nollywood films but this is definetly one of those you just can't afford to miss especially if you love love. The story was very crafted and the actors portrayed all the emotions in such a beautiful way. It's definitely one you will love to watch over and over again. Well done to everyone involved in the film making process. I was really impressed.",positive

"One of Nollywood's Best Movies Thus Far

As a half-Nigerian, I'd grown up with Nollywood movies, and majority of them, with an exception to one alien-themed budget film, were terrible. From the previous decade, Nollywood movies, at least those I saw on local channels and ""Africa Magic"", are of three varieties: Wrath and fall of backstabbers... with a bit of Missionary help by the climaxes, village-themed, and comedic movies featuring the same two dwarf actors... which includes Osita Iheme. As you might realize, due to the same Nollywood formulas over and over, I really got sick of watching Nigerian movies altogether.

But then, ""October 1"", and this movie, ""93 Days"", along with trailers for older movies, surprised me, and didn't. I was surprised that Nollywood movies started to feel world-class, to the point of competing with foreign films. On the other hand, I wasn't surprised because I knew we could do it. It even showed on our music industries years back.

This movie was well-directed and written to the point that I started sympathizing with the Ebola victims being portrayed. The transition from scene to scene felt world-class and, plot-wise, well-connected and well-referenced. The acting were excellent, even typically West African, from the Liberian patient to the cab driver. I also liked the quick information, in the Washington D.C setting, that Lagos being a major travel hub could put many countries at risk with Ebola.

And, unlike the typical Nollywood classics I dreaded so much, which ended in the climax, and offering no resolutions, ""93 Days"" has a really good resolution. I won't spoil it for anyone, since it's a new movie, but I can say that you must not miss this film. Even get it on Blu-ray or DVD if you must. (Also don't miss the extra scenes, and the photos of the real people the movie portray, in the credits.)",positive
"New Pandemic that could happen again!

It's a a brilliant movie and very realistic about what really happened. It's better than the movie Contagion in my book. It really hit close to home for me.

"Fantastic Series from Nigeria

I love love this series. Great scenery. Fantastic acting. Everybody was giving their A game. The jokes were natural and very relatable. It was educative as well. That case of the widow fighting her in laws was relatable and I honestly never knew the legal system in Nigeria could support her. Dakore was all woman - beautiful, fierce, smart and sexy, RMD grey foxiness was a perfect foil. Nneka oh Nneka. You lighten up my day anytime with her fiersomeness. I loved all her cares. And ode to Malik. Still waters run deep eh. Please what the heck happened to the bribery video??? Episode ended with my mouth agape. Well played Judge. Kwabena - our own playboy. Denola - got the part of the confused spoiled son to a tee. Finally redeemed himself in the last episodes.

I didnt agree with all the unorthodox hiring and firing and casual assault. but again, very relatable. Can't wait for Season 2.",positive
"Bingeworthy

Castle & Castle is a well written dramatic Nollywood series. The characters are multi-dimensional and realistic. As an American, I most enjoyed seeing the legal system in action against the backdrop of the uniqueness of Lagos. Each case offers a glimpse at the diversity within Nigerian culture. Every episode left me wanting to see MORE. I can't wait for Season 2. I am definitely a fan. Thank you, Netflix for making Castle & Castle available to us in the West.",positive
"Eagerly await season 2

I really love this show. Interesting characters, great storyline and writing.Can't wait for season 2.",positive
"Please let there be a Season 3
I truly enjoyed the accidental find! I wish I could purchase a poster from the opening title.

All of the actors were very good. I enjoyed how the show was able to explain the cultural themes without making it heavy. There is also a bit of levity that does not undermine the fact that the show is about a law firm.

It is well worth the Bing watch. Sadly it leaves Netflix 14 Dec 2021.

I truly, truly enjoy that the show portrays black Nigerian professionals at there best. Something sadly missing from American television.

I'd enjoy a season three.

I watched ""Fifty Series"" and came upon Castle & Castle because of Tola face was familiar. I love this series and would love for a season 2 to come! I just hate that if left me hanging on the last episode, like a season 2 would be coming. So please give us a season 2!!",positive

" 10/10
A film which captured a nation's hope for better cinema
luke_corradine23 January 2013
Warning: Spoilers
Its been almost a year since this film came out and an unbiased review is certainly easier to attempt now than ever before. Whoever watches this now or in the future have to understand that the film premiered a mere week after the Dana Air disaster which saw a Douglas MD-83 plunge into Lagos killing 150. Naturally the film was bound to face severe scrutiny in its homeland. A lot of those ""vibe""s have settled and the film remains a landmark and one of a kind on its own right.

As of 2013, Nigeria is mostly producing films which are deeply rooted in a homemade video culture which is hard to grasp by the westerner. Although I personally believe this country, under the right political vision, can be made into a gold mine for film, it is more than realistic to say that all that we have, for now, is a very productive although sub-par industry which most of the times calls films, what are in fact just video productions. 

In this climate, Last Flight to Abuja stands out for its quality, film-like screen presence and ambitious non-linear narrative as well as brilliant cinematography. It is also fair to say that Omotola, Kae-Kazim and Monjaro in particular, pull out some larger-than-life performances. I might as well add that these are actors who in all fairness, belong to a better industry, and its only a shame we don't get to see them at all in bigger productions. 

Last Flight also boasts great camera work which truly sets it on a league of its own. I believe the producers truly took quality to the forefront by shipping two Arri Alexa from Los Angeles for the shoot. The script which sits at the core of the film, was considered for a BAFTA nomination, and although it failed to realise the part in the end, it nevertheless stands as tribute to the quality which was put into this production and how this was appreciated beyond Nigeria.

The film was shot in a mere 14 days which is next to nothing for a story of this scale. This certainly stops the film from building into a true epic size, which perhaps would have been needed taking into account the subject matter. Still to this day, its casualty-free ending (only affected by the loss of the film's one villain) , is going to leave more than one unsatisfied. Although with foresight, there's not knowing if a bloodier end would have ever seen the film out. Considering how close the release was to the Dana Air disaster, that would have certainly been too much an impact for anyone to watch.

My last word is for director Obi Emelonye, who grabbed, with this film, a phenomenal success, beating The Dark Knight Rises and other blockbusters, in most theatres in Nigeria and Ghana. It is difficult to put a mark on Obi's cinematic impact in his country and beyond. We will have to wait another few years for that and see how Nigeria's film industry grows from this experience. Let me underline here that Obi's true legacy is not only that of his film's artistic value but also that of having restored confidence of Nigerian audiences in their own films. 

One can only wish that other Nigerian filmmakers will build on this same ground for a much brighter Nigerian film future.",positive
"Authentic!

This movie had so many parts that were real!

People do borrow clothes and cars and pose with them, lie through their teeth to drum up business and people do learn from their mistakes and extend a helping hand.

It was a great comedy with some good lessons including- don't believe the glitter!",positive
"Refreshingly good movie

I enjoyed the layers in the plot of the movie and the honest critique of Africa's wealthy politicians & affluent families.",positive
"Crazy,Lovely,Cool

My favorite Nigerian actress Adesua Etomi-wellington brought me to this tv series and I was not disappointed, it was a pleasant surprise to see good acting, really good writing on top of seeing her, all main characters had substance and were not over the top clich√© characters, each episode could stand on it's own with plot twists and reveals, if anybody is looking for a good binge watch you couldn't go wrong with this Nigerian gem",positive
"An Absolute fantastic storyline

This show is not it all what I thought it was going to be. It is 10 times better. The different issues by each of the students and how they collectively group together to work them out, excellent and very positive. I am hoping for a season two",positive
"where is season 2

I just watched season 1 and I really enjoyed it. Please do a season 2",positive
"excellent coming of age story.

I loved loved this show. I binged it and HOPE there is another season. I work in higher ed and the students depicted are true to form Great combination of comedy and drama. Wisdom made me laugh so hard. He was excellent. the blend of the story lines were great.",positive
"A perfect story!

Amazingly realistic. It depicts the life and story of young Nigerian men living in Lagos.",positive
"Amazing

The storyline is quiet interesting, the actors are amazing and it wasn't as predictable as I thought it would.. Picture quality is awesome, Molly wood has really grown.",positive
"This movie will englighten you

As a Nigerian I know we have three major tribes: Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba. However, you don't hear the mention of Hausa in places like America. This is so sad because the Hausa tribe is the largest tribe in land mass and population in Nigeria. It's as if apart from the presidency, they have nothing left to offer, like they are meaningless to the country. Hausa's are termed the poorest-illiterates in the country. You hardly see or hear them in entertainment so the world isn't aware they even exist. This movie just resurfaced them, the music especially during the festival, was amazing I had to use Shazam, I wish they will make more movies like this. The Hausa tribe needs to be heard!",positive
"the best Nigerian Movie in decades

Honestly, this movie brought back great memories and gave me deep thoughts. This is the best movie out of Nigeria in more than a decade. This compares to old Nigerian movie classics. Kudos to Banky W, this man is pure class. I do not watch Nigerian movies because of the ""garbage"" most churn out, but this move right here deserves an Oscar.

Absolute 10/10",positive
"Let me quickly drop my thoughts

This movie relates to the current situation of most Nigerian youths, it doesn't matter how you make your money Just be successful that's all. Nice delivery from Gabriel, definitely one of our best actors! #Mustwatch for all Nollywood fans",positive
"my number one nigeria sci fi best movie
I love the movie, it falls into my favorite type which i am satisfy off, looking forward for nigeria to bring more to screen.

And my advice for us Nigerian is to support this movie to encourage them to bring and produce more better movies of our choice for us to watch.",positive
"Better than days of our live

Well written, acted, directed. Awesome soap opera about big boys in Nigeria. This is among my favorite series or productions out of Nigeria. Well done and enjoy!",positive
"A Must See - Sons of the Caliphate

I watched Season 1 and 2 on Netflix in the USA. This TV series is excellent. It has everything a viewer could want from Suspense to Romance to Action. Love the actors, script, storyline, culture and location. The characters all have strong, multi-dimensional personalities regardless of gender. I'm hooked on this show and am looking for Season 3 which has not posted to Netflix yet. Hopefully I can find it elsewhere. If you are a Black Panther movie fan, you will probably enjoy this series as well. It is filled with villians and good guys, unexpected twists and ah hah moments. Would highly recommend.",positive
"This show should have 5 seasons!!!!

This show was so interesting and entertaining. If the real Caliphate has a problem with it. Change or abbreviate the name, abeg. Great cast!!! Great writing!!! Great visuals. :)",positive
"Captivating

Zainab was captivating in her role as Sylvia. It left me hoping for a sequel. Throughout the twist and turns of the movie I could not help but be glued to the tv. I found myself pulling for Sylvia. Her seductiveness and witty demeanor was only surpassed by her outstanding acting skills.",positive
"Awesome

The first time I saw this movie I was blown away. I don't want to sound crazy but I try to study things of this world. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it, especially if they are truly into deities like I am. I hope to see a second installment with the same characters and a darker plot.",positive
"My own understanding

The storyline is interesting and I loved everything about the movie üî•üî•",positive
"Amazing movie

It was a wow movie, from the cast to the storyline.. it was flowing, it gave all the emotions high and low.. such a beautifully written movie. Worth every cent..",positive
"Entertaining Fashionable & Educational!!!

Loved It All! Awesome Actresses! Entertaining Fashionable & Educational!!! These writers and directors were so on point. I started watching this a while ago, but stopped within the 1st few mins. I completely forgot to go back. I'm soooo glad I backtracked. This series had me begging for more. I'm a major fan of these women and men now. More, Please!",positive
"One of the best in African drama series

The talent, top notch , such quality acting from those ladies, hands down perfect.and the script was informative and well executed.

Keep it up Nollywood you're on the right track.",positive
"Original

I am impressed. And I am rarely with 9ja movies/series. But am here at 1am watching this. It connects the dots. Kudos to the effort. Arese kudos. Dealing with money is a rarely discussed topic yet everyone blames income. This addresses expenses and management principles. At the heartbeat of it is transparency with self and those one can hold accountable.",positive
"excellent Performances~

Well done! The performances by the entire cast was good, especially the actress who plays the mother along with the male and female lead. Would definitely watch more stories like this. The only thing I disagree with is the title. Since she was not the true villian, black rose does not seem like an apt title.",positive
"Level Up!

Nollywood movies are getting up where we want it. I loved the acting, storyline & casting line-up of this movie. Its a good romcom in a Naija way!

Nice acting y' all. . .",positive
"Very inspirant
I appreciate the story and all the intrigue. Sometimes i found angry but the end is beautiful. We have to decide for our life, nobody will do it for us.

The bosses loves only our hand and brain to help them succeed. But they aneliate us if we don't take care.

I appreciate the dresses of the actor principal. She is beautifull with her braids - natural is better.",positive
"
This is the nollywood evolution

This is arguably my best Nigeria movie for year 2019. I cannot find any misplaced in this movie, perfectly executed, simple and so informative about our society n thought provoking on career part for our children",positive
"so cool

This was so chilled. this movie was fun and enjoyable from the start. I've found no flaws to it, maybe the introduction is a little corny, but thats just taste. this movie was light but meaningful. highly recommended!",positive
"A very good movie with a good lesson!

This is movie is about a coming of age comedy/drama about a young boy who wants to fix things with his hands rather sit behind a cubicle. In a broader sense, I think this is just celebrating how things are done in Africa, and how kids learn to be humble.

I was really supprise by the cinimatography, story, and acting. I used to watch a lot movies from Nigeria but soon realize that the quality sometimes just isn't there for me but this movie just reminded that I need to explore more.",positive
"A much needed mascarade

This is not just another naija silly film. It's still silly and Nigerian, but in a witty, essentially thought-provoking way. It's a statement. An indepth look into physical vs spiritual balance, which we're all seeking today. A fable with humble esthetics.",positive
"Nigerian New Wave!

Thoroughly enjoyed the film! It was authentic, honest, absurdist, comical & inquisitive in all right ways.

I truly feel like this film was tailor made for me. I'm just realizing that this is the first/only movie that's actually told from MY perspective. I'm the target audience for this film!

And I'm looking forward to Abba's next feature!",positive
"i enjoyed the movie, and its overall message, that was frankly superimposed at all times. but the movie had a positive and optimistic message, so i found story development and everything to be appropriate.",positive
"These people deserve a whole fucking lot of credit for this movie. The writing is eh. Performances are eh. But so, so hard, and they did it. You have to appreciate that. ",positive
Great movie. It's a good watch. it was thoughtful and not a lot of forceful acting. It was good,positive
It is a well directed and produced movie with a very sensitive theme. The story is well told and brought to life with an amazing cast.,positive
It almost accurately portrayed the abuses a lot female students face in Nigerian universities and west Africa at large,positive
"Excellent Film

We have become so accustomed to one way of directing/producing a film. I believe that a film has to be reviewed based on it's own merit, not some made up standard.

This was a great film. A very simple storyline that provides a glimpse into the past to two boys (with many unknowns).. then the twists and turns that surround their reunion as grown men.

I especially enjoyed that many vague points or events where many viewer made assumptions that were clarified at the end. That, in itself, was very creative. As well, we have a credible view into another culture.

Well done! So different from anything I've ever scene.",positive
"Terrific film!

I had the pleasure of seeing August the First at SXSW this week. Of the 20 plus films I've seen at the festival, this has been the best. I'm still emotional about it.

This is an intense, heartbreaking family drama with an excellent script and stellar acting performances. But there's nothing over-the-top or exaggerated. Tunde's graduation party becomes the scene of a reunion, unwanted by all but Tunde, with a father who had abandoned his family 10 years earlier, moved to Nigeria, and started a new family there.

I really got to know these characters. I was particularly impressed with Joy Merriweather as Tunde's mother Rhonda, drinking to try to alleviate her pain and resentment, and by Kerisse Hutchinson as Simisola, the daughter who can't forget. Oh, and by Sean Phillips as big brother Ade and Ian Alsup as the idealistic Tunde. Oh, and by Dennis Rubin Green as the father, and by everyone else as well.

I really hope this makes it to general release and DVD.",positive
"Great Tale

This is a premium movie anytime. Tells the tales of our society decay . So sad ! So true!",positive
"Beautiful, Captivating, Powerful, Raw

This movie captured the troubles faced by the average Gen Z Nigerian kid. It did not gloss over anything. It left you angry and annoyed at some places. It left you triggered which I think was the point. To force the viewer to live the reality of the characters. I'm happy this story got told.",positive

"Breathtakingly nice movie!

I was browsing Netflix one night trying to find a movie or TV show connected to London, as I haven't been there in quite a while and started to miss the streets and urban atmosphere. This came up during the search. At first I was a bit skeptical, as I wasn't exposed to Nigerian cinema before. However, by the end of the movie (brilliantly done by the way), I realised that I witnessed an audio-visual masterpiece. Highly recommend!",positive
"This story is no fiction. The doctor who saved her country (and probably the world) from a deadly outbreak of Ebola has died from it. This very moving movie retraces what happened in Lagos in July 2014 with force and simplicity. The actors are convincing, true... It's sad, obviously, but also enriching with hope.",positive
"This film is done at a slow, steady, believable pace. I was completely drawn into the story and connected with all the actors as if I knew them. It is a horrible story of an Ebola attack in Nigeria. I cried the whole way through the second half because it is just that devastating. I will never understand how anywhere on this planet could be lacking a full equipped hospital with air condition running water, and all the things an emergency - infectious disease facility should have in 2014 - including individual quarantine areas for the afflicted. I honestly believe those who did die might have been saved had there been more resources. It is a must watch because this film really puts things into perspective for those of us who love to complain here in the USA. Lastly, it is a story of courage, sticking together, support & love between human beings - friends strangers co-workers and family. It is all of this that makes this one incredible true story. I am so sorry this happened. I just wish I knew where this deadly virus came from.

This was an excellent movie. I would recommend it to anyone!,positive

"Beautiful movie depicting historic events in Benin kingdom

This movie was very educational and interesting to watch. I am still in shock it was done in 2014. The acting and directing was superb. Some reviews that heavily criticised this work seem racist and angry the white men were portrayed as wicked people.

Kudos to the cast and crew.",positive
"A must watch
Beautiful romance movie. I just decided to try it when saw it on Netflix and there was nothing to regret. The songs chosen were really good.",positive
"Amazing and Crazy Hilarious
This is the most hilarious movie I have come across this year. And it even uses something I have never seen in a movie before, the use of hilarious quotes. The acting, story, cinematography and directing are all on point. Super impressed.",positive
"Very Different!

This is not your everyday movie. The star actors really deserve awards for their roles. I loved every minute of it. Please watch!",positive
"Pleasant Surprise! Great Acting!!

Don't understand the low rating for this film at all. I happened upon this great movie by accident and I'm so glad I did. Usually when you see movies from Africa her in America is in the jungle and all of that stereotypical shows. But anyone with a pea size brain should realize that there is so much more to the motherland than what America wants us to see. Movies like this is one of them. It depicts Africans and Africans acting in films like any other movie with a great plot. Watch this and see another side of Africa that is sorely needed here in America. The storyline had me on edge and I could NOT figure out the ended. It was fantastic!!! You will not be disappointed. The have. Chris Attoch who is affectionally known as the The Denzel Washington in many places in Africa in the film and he's great even with a small role. Adeusa Etomi and Uzor Arukwe give stella performances as the films main characters.",positive

So relatable! Sad there is only one season. Stayed up til 2am watching this show!",positive

I have seen this movie 5 times already. i really like the movie",positive
"Just stunning

Such a beautiful movie. Stunning scenes of Africa. A beautiful depiction of an accidental love story with believable characters looking for more in life i.e. Love, family and fulfillment of dreams. Makes you feel good all round.",positive
"Beautiful movie

Probably the first and only local movie I have watched end to end and more than once. Saw it first when it came out in 2012 and 3 years down the line, I seem to love it all the more. Found some faulty scenes though for instance, I thought the fact that Akin didn't realize he had someone else' phone (especially as he read a text message on it) was a bit out of place. I thought the phones were similar but not exactly the same - bold 9000 vs bold 9900). I also thought the end where Akin kept the luggage in the trunk himself while the driver stayed put in the car (that's not so usual) was also faulty.

But outside those few quirks here and there, it was an all round entertainer. Good job",positive
"Shows corruption in its splendor

An African drama. It deals with an irregular governor elections where in a district there are murders, which makes the commisssions annul in that place, that causes the candidate who lost to start a campaign where she proclaims herself the legitimate president and takes the case to court so that they can be do justice to electoral fraud. Does history sound familiar to you? I think things like that don't just happen in Mexico, it's global. Quality. Entertaining. Some actions are not fully achieved but it works. The torture and murder scenes are well managed. It explores corruption, electoral fraud, party influences, and mismanagement in the political sphere. The third act takes a turn that will leave you with a sour taste of the film.",positive
"This story was a beautiful picture of the balance of joy and sorrow during the time of the Nigerian Civil War. The actors paint vivid images of the realities of setbacks and victories in life set against the backdrop of a country in turmoil and seeking to grasp its own identity. I loved it and I would recommend it. If you are looking for something that will give you shallow stereotypical narratives of Africa, this is not the film. However, if you are seeking a film that will challenge your previous understandings and grow your compassion, this is DEFINITELY the film for you
",positive
"No words to describe the power of this movie and its reminder of how fortunate it is to have never lived through a civil war. Extraordinary story telling of tragic, recent Nigerian history and the humanity within it all.",positive
Fantastic lead acting. Left emotionally devastated. Story is powerful.,positive
This film is is a true story and is aposlutely brilliant and moving.,positive
"I  just watched this at The Newport Beach Film Festival, and this has got to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. The movie had a good pace with excellent writing & production. This movie is one of those movies that you can never forget. The cast was perfection. The chemistry between the two lead characters was undeniable. And the best part of this movie is that it is based on a true story. Watch it!!! Support GOOD movies.",positive
I have read the book and i thought that the film was brilliant with very strong performances by the main actors. One of the best films I have seen this year with old news footage interwoven with the main story,positive

"Destiny Ekaragha's ""Gone Too Far"" is so London, so Naijia, so Jamaica, and just so hilarious to boot. It had me in stitches, laughing so hard until those stitches opened. Loved the movie's fast paced story-line, catchy sound tracks, brilliant cast, talented actors (especially Golda John as Mum), and the right on point dialogue such as: ""I want everyone to text immigration and say, give sunshine a stake in London."" ""But is he really African though? His parents are African, but is he African?"" ""What does an African look like?"" ""I don't know, an African innit."" ""A Yoruba accent is the sexist accent in the whole wide world. Ask anyone with sense."" ""You need to let them know you're an African, bruv... Let them know the Afs, we're here: big Afs, small Afs, round Afs, Japanese Afs. We are here! What an excellent movie, with Radio DJ running commentaries and tracks that make the movie reminiscent of Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"". Basically, ""Gone Too Far"" is a cultural studies keeper! Watched it thrice already, plus buying me a copy soon.",positive
fantastic movie,positive
"One of the greatest artistic pieces of all time

This film is undeniably one of the greatest movies of our generations. This film plays with the viewers emotions through its entirety and did a fantastic job mixing the different genres the film industry has to offer.

"Doctor Lanre' is an Interesting Shift

I am glad to be one of the first on the train of this movie. This is an interesting shift. The story has a rich plot that is carried effortlessly by the superb performances of the cast. While the performances of the lead, Okey Uzoeshi and Bolaji Ogunmola are applaudable, it is Blessing Obasi that has stolen my heart.

This is a must-see.",positive
"Great Piece

This is a well crafted, mind blowing work. The fact that I couldn't guess or know how it was going to end, blew my mind. The suspense is top notch. No unnecessary clip to prolong the movie but straight to the point. This is changing the narrative of Nollywood movies. Cheers to the Writer and Director. Highly recommended.",positive

I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Beautifully shot and delightfully funny.,positive
Lovely movie... a mix of everything,positive
"This movie is a beautiful representation of a modern life for a family faces with running a failing company in Nigeria, the camera play, acting and just overall environment of the movie exceeded its expectations.

Lot of lessons within a simple simple movie. The story was very good and comforting.,positive
A rare story about the values of family from a very distinctive perspective. Eloquently interpreted with perfect casting,positive
Film showcases a dynamic look at Nigeria from the lenses of a progressive female protagonist navigating her way through a male dominated business culture. It keeps a light and fun energy at the same time and a compelling family oriented story line. The characters particularly the Uncle are funny and engaging. The characters feel well fleshed out and the quality of production is solid. I would recommend streaming √Ø¬ø 1/2 1/2 1/2~this Netflix original!,positive
"It was completely refreshing to watch from start to finish. An intresting deviation from the typical Nollywood movie. Veteran actors Pete Edochie and Nkem Owoh effortlessly show us why they are the best in Nollywood. Genevieve definitely sets a standard for local Nollywood movies with Lions Heart and as for her Directorial debut, someone give her an award!",positive

This is a must see movie. I was very impressed!!!,positive
"How does a movie with this subject matter wind up being this slow and boring? Where is the urgency? Where is the suspense and tension? The editing and the pacing drove me nuts and there's just no way this thing needed to be nearly two and half hours long. And that's really a shame because it highlights a really big and important problem, I just wish it did so without putting the audience to sleep.
",positive
This is my favourite Nigerian film. Really enthralling debut feature.,positive
"Really Good Movie
This is probably the best Nigerian movie I've ever seen. Definitely a class above your usual light Nollywood stuff. Characters and plot were well developed and realistic. Noah and Dominic were really great in their acting.

And the movie props! I am sooo impressed! The ancient vehicles (404), appropriate hairstyles and attire and house decor. The producers and directors did their homework. It took me down memory lane. The movie was intense throughout, I couldn't even pause until the movie ended! Bravo!

At last a Nigerian movie that keeps viewers at the edge of their seats and was not predictable. Well done to those behind the effort",positive
"MY FAVORITE ROMCOM, YOU BITCHES COULD NEVER!!! and i was rooting for the white man... what about it? i can hate em and love em at the same time, the duality of man. thank you",positive
This was my first Nigerian film and certainly won't be my last. Wow the outfits were amazing and sets everything was so colorful I loved it. I love how feminist this was. Isoken stood up for what she believed in and learned to not take shit from anyone her character development was so nice to see. Kevin and Isoken had such amazing chemistry. This was such a vibrant and fun film I really enjoyed it.,positive

"It is interesting that For Maria is a 2020 movie and is now available on Netflix in 2022. This is an overall excellent Nollywood production, and deserves to be seen by everyone. ",positive
"This return of the king is glorious.  
",positive
"The use of proverbs, innuendos, and play on words, provides so many memorable one liners and quotes that will remain on our tongues for a long time. We will quote the lines and recall the pleasure of watching this series. ",positive
" The costume designers understood the assignment and brought all to the table. The clothes given to Oba, Eniola Salami, for every single scene she appears in shows careful thought and a synergy between the cast and crew of this movie. It is the kind of synergy and excellence we have clamoured for in Nollywood. 
",positive
"The casting of KOB2 gives the most appropriate roles to the people who would leave all on the screen, and they give stellar performances, including those who had non-speaking roles and cameo appearances. The acting is on point, so much that even facial expressions spoke volumes. In particular, Eniola Salami, played by Sola Sobowale, used facial expressions in silence, saying nothing, yet speaking loudly, is an image of the quintessential Yoruba mother",positive
"The post script scene will have you laughing out of the cinema hall, and you will find yourself breaking out in a grin each time you recall flashes of the movie.",positive
"My Village People is a movie that will have you losing your home training while watching it.¬†But it is a pathfinder of sorts. Nollywood generally has not done a good job of making the supernatural sexy and appealing. My Village People achieves it effortlessly, and deserves copious amount of praise.",positive
"This movie, My Village People, gives us a very interesting plot twist that has us laughing and giving an applause, and the conflict resolution is well done, in terms of the script and the acting.",positive
"My Village People delivered fantastic special effects, and they are not over the top. One of my favourite special effects is the rain. The technical crew deserves special recognition for their skills in this movie",positive
"Technically, the sound is very good, and camera angles and techniques are unusual and interesting. The fight scenes are well choreographed;  you see real action, and you feel a sense of satisfaction. The movie serves up a real action comedy, provides the right mix of laughter and action, as well as the right amount of danger. The few points of idiocy do not take away from the excellence of Mamba‚Äôs Diamond.",positive
"The comedy is of a wide spectrum; you laugh at the bumbling petty thieves, and you guffaw at how two men, standing over the body of the person they have just stabbed in the heart, calmly discuss being called to pastor! The same men get very upset when someone swears, and ask the person to say his last prayer while they bow their heads.

While one or two scenes could be better, they do not take away from the excellent script writing and dialogue. I do not understand why a law enforcement officer would be spilling the details of a case to a man she has rescued twice in the same day. I think it is unprofessional, but it needs to work into the script somehow. But mostly, actions are believable. ",positive
"From the pair of God-fearing cold-blooded killers who exchange sermons and dream of pastoring, two bumbling petty criminals, the always smiling female head of a crime empire, to a corrupt police officer on the payroll of the Mafia head, Mamba‚Äôs Diamond has it all. The movie starts with a suspenseful bang. It moves from South Africa to New York to Nigeria. This does not begin like your regular comedy. Within the first 15 minutes, 6 people have been killed in cold blood because of this diamond. The movie drags you to the edge of your seat and demands that you pay full attention. ",positive
"Breaded Life is a true Nigerian romantic comedy that will tug at your heartstrings, and you will want to see it again and again.  
",positive
"Every single character in the movie did an excellent job. This includes Biodun Stephen playing a cameo role. But Bimbo Ademoye and Timini Egbuson deserve the best accolades. Bimbo is such a versatile actor, it is a beautiful thing to watch. She embodies the character of the bread seller, who life keeps dealing a bad hand, yet she rolls with it and makes the best of it. Bimbo must have trained for months; you will believe she is an Egun woman. She also speaks the language, both of the street and of the character, beautifully.

Timini Egbuson has truly grown as an actor, and it is refreshing to see him able to follow the development of his character from a spoiled rich kid to a hard-working street hustler.  The chemistry they both display on the screen is a thing of beauty to see. 
",positive
"While every movie or work of art has its flaws, Breaded Life is almost perfect. A few of the scenes may have gone on a tad longer than necessary, but they do not detract from the overall enjoyment of the story. The locations are perfect for the movie, giving us such a rich viewing experience, moving us from the affluent neighbourhoods to the almost destitute areas where people have to work for daily wages. ",positive
"Breaded Life is the classic story of rich boy, poor girl romance, but with a plot twist that speaks of excellent and out-of-the-box thinking. It is the kind of feel-good story that leaves you grinning from ear to ear.  The rich boy finds himself at the mercy of the benevolence of the poor girl, who turns out to be his life-saver.

The story draws you in so much that you find a bit of yourself in all the characters. It weaves everyday character, everyday life, everyday comedy into a story of self discovery, paying penance for years of indulgent living, and concluding in a reveal that the director has been subtly hinting at, but which you are not able to touch till it is handed to you. You keep guessing, but when the reveal happens, it is so satisfying that you are happy for the suspense. ",positive
"If you are looking for a tight plot, excellent acting, unusual reveals, and situational comedy, with a touch of home-grown romance, this is the movie for you.  Breaded Life has the viewers laughing from the first scene and does not let up till the last scene, including the post script. This movie, which is a cocktail of laughter, emotions, with a strong vine of authentic romance holding it all together, is a sequel to an earlier one by the same director, Biodun Stephen. I am glad to see that it is a refreshing departure from how Nollywood does sequels. It was not a direct continuation of the previous story, but characters from there were seamlessly flowed into this. ",positive
"This movie feels like a mish mash of under-developed ideas with a half hearted romance thrown in. It is not sure if it wants to be a comedy or a satire. As slapstick comedy, it falls short of the expected full-on laughter and ridiculousness. As a satire, it does not have enough ingredients and irony to truly carry that flag. It is full of social media slangs, trending hashtags, and the worst of poverty cliches. ",positive
"The production quality of La Femme Anjola is very good. It is hard to believe it is not Rita Dominic singing directly, which speaks of very good directing and editing.",positive
"I enjoyed seeing very good parts of Lagos, both on the mainland and the island, used, unlike other movies that stay in one location. Lagos is a beautiful place to shoot a movie, especially if the diversity of the state is put to use, as seen here. Accident scenes are usually tricky for Nollywood to portray, but it was a pleasant surprise to see a very believable one here. ",positive
"La Femme Anjola is a well packaged Crime-thriller that deserves every award coming its way. I look forward to more beautiful storytelling like this. Movies of this overall outstanding quality may cost a bit more, but they are totally worth it. Nobody can tell our stories like us, and we need to tell them in ways that are unique to us.¬†",positive
"The quality of the script cannot be faulted. It shows a well researched storyline that flows naturally and has no stilted parts. You would keep wondering, thinking you had solved the crime, only for you to later realise the script is several steps ahead of you. The movie is two and half hours in length, but there is no dull moment.",positive

To summarize the plot, it was leaking like a sieve.

The characters somehow became a lot more annoying and unrealistic, plus no tangible development. Was it funny? Maybe it could be if you don't spend the near 2hrs watching the movie wanting to punch the director/screenwriter.

Why do these caliber of films make it past the home video format and into the big screens (platform wise) in big 2022? The world is watching, and these people are doing Nollywood's reputation no good... look at Nigeria's music industry for a change!",negative
"A WASTE OF TIME

Wow... Chief daddy 2 is way worse than chief daddy 1, and I would rate chief daddy 1, a good 0.5/5.

This movie is bad... Very bad

Story line is incoherent, plot was non existent, actors were below par.

I am shocked that this came from Ebonylife studios. A star studded cast did nothing for the movie... Except make it obvious that the director Niyi Akinmolayan has no idea what he was doing.

I am also shocked that Mo Abudu is the writer.

This movie is worse than appalling

It was a waste if 1hr and 50 mins.

"First disaster recorded in 2022

A painstaking experience is the movie suggests that the entire cast and crew aim was to achieve the first disaster in 2022. A Netflix release date of 1st of January 2022 further suggests that was the sole intention. The acting was bad, the soundtrack were repetitive, the storyline was...

"Does not live up to Production Value

This movie was a movie that had great potential. A directorial debut of the Famous Nigerian Genevieve, packed with star studded Nigerian Names from Phyno, to Pete edochie. It also Had really fantastic production value, however that's as far as positives go.

One thing that a good movie needs above all else is ""story"". the story usually sets actors up for fantastic pe formances, can usually be the thing to sell a movie. However, this failed to be anything other than boring. It had no logical flow. It was trying to do a lot of things, like develop a love interest for Genevieve, set her up as a hardworking female, however it offers nothing in terms of bringing that to life. There should have been more connections to the characters, like what does Lionheart mean ?? Who exactly are these characters. It feels very empty and quickly put together.

Building on from that, another thing that makes movie so terrible is, because the story is terrible the actors cannot live up to their potential. They're stuck in a bad story, so there's nothing to immerse themselves in.

The film also has terrible writing which also contributes to the actor's terrible performances. I don't know who wrote this but it was really off the mark for writing. Some of the dialogue was so superficial and empty. They threw in some inspirational words here and there to try and do soemthing but it had no effect because they hadn't prepared for it properly. There was also a serious lack of research witht the writing. When you borrow 950 million naira,which is basically 2.6 million dollars, no company takes that kind of loan and pays back fully in a year. People pay interests on that loan, so that really messed up the story and writing. Also was the evil coworker a board member ?? What was he doing at those meetings ?? And how can a company which has a board be unaware of a 2.6 million dollar loan. It's jsust not possible, that's not how business works. It feels as if real life was bent to fit the terrible narrative this movie was trying to tell.

The only positive of this movie is production value. The cinematography is average holly wood standard, although it falters a lot. It's evident of a quite low budget Hollywood movie. It's netflix quality, let me put it that way in terms of original content. However, it still needs to improve. I think Genevieve needs to go on a masters in directing from a good film school to understand how to properly direct, it is really important she does that.

In conclusion, this was a movie that could have been groundbreaking in terms of Nigeria's first original Netflix content. However m perhaps shockingly, seeing as it was bought by Netflix, it was absolutely poor. And writing, bad story, bad acting. I can only congratulate the production value of this.",negative
"Terrible Movie... worst Nigerian movie I've seen

Movie is so bad I had to create an account just to write this and let others know",negative
"Very disappointing adaptation of great novel

Half of a Yellow Sun is a fantastic novel, so any adaptation was going to be very difficult. Adapting a great book should be approached with care and most successful adaptations have focused on one or two key events or characters rather than try to retell the whole story. In this case, the adaptation attempted to tell the whole story and, subsequently, manages to avoid any depth as it simply skims along the surface in order to get the end. Often, scenes which serve no point other than to relay a piece of background information continually appear and it is shocking that such experienced film makers failed to guide the writer/director away from such obvious pitfalls. In order to accommodate as many details as possible from the novel, many superfluous scenes lead only to confusion and rely on the audience either having read the novel or having in-depth knowledge of Nigeria's history. Some characters appear only to serve as expositional devices. This film has one or two excellent performances DESPITE the material but generally the actors appear to be at a loss as to what to do. This is the director's first movie and it could that he wasn't comfortable with the pressures of time and of shooting out of sequence. 

It is sad to be so 'down' on a movie that has its heart in the right place, and one can only imagine that Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie must rue the day that she allowed her beautiful work to be adapted by someone who had little or no grasp of the screen writing process that could have turned out a great film script.",negative
"One of the worst

With the hype I would expect a great movie but this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. Great actors and good cast but the storyline and unnecessary scene create attention. I'm surprise some people actually find this movie fun because I couldn't really associate fun with this movie.

I have found it my obligation to talk about this topic as I have recently viewed this movie. The issues in todays modern age is racial profiling and racism which is a serious matter. I address this movie to be very misleading and further promotes discrimination by presenting African people uncivilised by having the typical stereotypes of African people in robes and acting like caveman thousands of years ago.

"The Worst Music Scoring Ever!

Whoever did the music scoring for this movie did a horrible job. It must have been their first time scoring a movie. The music was very excessive...almost every scene which was very unnecessary. It overshadowed the dialogue in the scenes to the point where you cannot hear what the characters are saying. How did the director, producers, editors, etc. Thought it was acceptable for so intrusive music I do not know. Music in a film is supposed to add and enhance the telling of the story of a film and unfortunately the music took away and hindered the film. I could not enjoy due to that reason.",negative
"Weak dialogue, amateurish battle scenes.

Seeing this movie was torture, an infliction of pain that permeated my bone marrow - and it is so perhaps because I'm a History graduate who could not help but notice the many goofs in the plot, acting and battle choreography gone bad. The colonial officers didn't sound British. The dialogue was plain, so much on the surface. How many holes were dug to sink this movie? And coming from an ace 'Nollywood' director I root for, I'm disappointed.

Why on God's green earth was there a 1960s transistorized shortwave radio beside someone wearing a white uniform with a modern day Anarchist logo on his shoulder...I could go on and on, and I'm appalled by the many things not gotten right here because this subject was my term paper in my third year and I had an A in this course (blowing my trumpets? No!) - all I'm saying is that the director, who was also the writer and other crew members, could do better. This was meant to be a historical fiction that was meant to expose the thievery of the British colonial administrators (and their callous pilfering of the Great and sophisticated Benin Empire) but it didn't do justice.

Lancelot could have done better even with the limitations.

My verdict: this movie needs a remake! A remake!",negative
"Don't waste your time
Did not watch all of this crap.

Just what were they thinking with this ""movie"". It is probably one of the worst things I have seen in decades, fragmented storyline, completely ridiculous premise and the acting is some of the most painful I've seen.

"Worst remake

How could they get it so wrong? Despite all the technical innovations that weren't available to Amaka Igwe in 1995, she was still able to create a classic. Noah somehow managed to detribalize a well known classic ethnic movie that had enthralled its audience with its language and culture. The actors were sub par at best. There was poor directing at the beginning during Ahannas flashbacks when he witnessed a man being set ablaze. The man who was set on fire didn't act realistically,he remained really calm despite being on fire. This was one of many directing mistakes that could be identified in the movie.",negative

I am baffled that Netflix would subject its audience to this kind of low budget rubbish.

The script is boring and without substance, the main theme of the movie doesn't start until the last 20 minutes of the film. The main theme, i.e. the crash and events leading up to it, were rushed and offered no details on how the crew handled the issue - I certainly hope that the Dana crew were a little more proactive than these two. The pilot uniforms looked like they were made by a toddler, the epaulets looked were yellow tape glued on top of black tape - really?, the director couldn't be bothered to borrow some epaulets or even a uniform from a line pilot. The whole thing is amateurish. Any High School film student or Youtuber would make a better film than this abhorrent junk.",negative

Within the first 5 minutes I knew what I was in for.

What a mess. I understand they were probably doing the best with what they had, but I really can not find anything redeeming to say about this film.

Seeing this movie was torture, an infliction of pain that permeated my bone marrow - and it is so perhaps because I'm a History graduate who could not help but notice the many goofs in the plot, acting and battle choreography gone bad. The colonial officers didn't sound British. The dialogue was plain, so much on the surface. How many holes were dug to sink this movie? And coming from an ace 'Nollywood' director I root for, I'm disappointed.

Why on God's green earth was there a 1960s transistorized shortwave radio beside someone wearing a white uniform with a modern day Anarchist logo on his shoulder...I could go on and on, and I'm appalled by the many things not gotten right here because this subject was my term paper in my third year and I had an A in this course (blowing my trumpets? No!) - all I'm saying is that the director, who was also the writer and other crew members, could do better. This was meant to be a historical fiction that was meant to expose the thievery of the British colonial administrators (and their callous pilfering of the Great and sophisticated Benin Empire) but it didn't do justice.

This movie was so poorly made that I only got through the first half hour (or so); after trying twice.

The opening scene looks like they are playing ""Red Light - Green Light,"" with the criminal.

The events that are used to drive the plot are way too coincidental (and, at times, confusing).

The indoor scenes look they were shot on a cellular telephone, in someone's living room. The lighting was flat; and the set looked heavily staged.

"Finally saw the film, and to understate my aversion for what was on display on my phone's screen for about an hour 35 mins, it yearns for so much √∞~. From poor directing, to crap story; questionable acting to illogicality; shallow sceenwriting to bad editing... The film set out to tranverse a potentially-rewarding terrain hitherto unexplored in Nollywood - the story of a lady trying to keep her father's trans company afloat is a welcome one - but it failed woefully in complexifying its conflict and offering didactic lessons to people seeking redemption from their business tribulations √∞¬§"". Hence, it ended up becoming a vehicle that misses its route, decides to follow the path of other nollywood films and then tries to create the illusive impression of being different from the rest.√¢~  Genevieve's directing of the film was decent according to Nollywood standards, but the International audience of filmmakers will be sceptical about the director's credentials when thry see the film. But I understand Geny, she's an actor transitioning to directing. When I started watching the film, I saw five people credited as the screenwriters for the film. One of them, CJ Obasi, is a man I respect his radical tendencies in the industry. So, that upped my enthusiasm about seeing the film. Fast-forward one and half hour later, and I'm asking myself, how much research was done in the writing of this film√∞¬ß?? I wont be surprised if it's zilch. The dialogues are hardly thought-provoking, lots of unnecessary characters (Phyno's, Peter Okoye etc) who's roles are hardly explored nor add anything to the central case. I'm still pondering how that conversation between Geny's character and Alhaji Maikano and then Maikano/Edochie's character resulted in Maikano's decision to agree a merger with a company defaulting on its loan and agree to clear its 950 million debt. The people that wrote that script crucified sound screenwriting, logic and reality.√¢? The film made little effort to clear dark corners in the stories, thereby leaving itself with enormous plot holes big enough to damage a LION'S HEART. I could go on and on pinpointing loop holes in the elements about the film, but suffice to say that although the film left me begging for more, I wouldn't stop short of acknowledging the originality given to the characters. Edochie and Osuofia's characters gave me all I needed from a typical traditional Igbo man runnning a transport business. But generally the script failed to explore the characters to provide us with motivations behind their actions... cc: Ikeagwu's resolve to see the company sold. √∞¬§¬∑√∞? 1/4√¢?√¢(TM), The local feel was fun: the area boys/agberos in the opening scene made me laugh.",negative

Her freak out goes down as one of the best of all time. It fails to tell a compelling story about drug addiction or the corruption of a teenager.

There is an unemployed graduate waiting for the perfect job. All of them connected together by a gynaecologist who is waiting for a life partner. They are all waiting in the waiting room of life. 

Working with the script they have, the actors interpret the characters to the best of their abilities, but this is one movie that shows that not all books translate well  into movies.

No matter how funny a comedy is, it would have some serious scenes to tie the story together and pull at your heart strings, and give you some break from the continual laughter.

"A travesty

Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Half of a Yellow Sun is a great, heart breaking novel; an evocation of four beautifully drawn, vivid characters whose lives are forever changed by the brutalities of the Biafran struggle, the Nigerian civil war. The opening few chapters draw us into the background against which the book's central characters must stand; the eventually disastrous effects of British colonialism, the contemptuous racism of the British ex pats, the depth and beauty of Igbo-Ukwu art, the enmity between the different peoples of Nigeria, the corruption, and the struggle for African identity, for self-determination and independence. This film replaces a superbly written, perfectly paced introduction with a single scene, that reduces one of the book's most complex meetings into two shots and a couple of lines of dialog. In short this film is so rushed, so much of a squeezed accordion, with no idea of what themes to lift from the page, that it renders the events confused, meaningless and, for those of us who gave read the book, entirely, unavoidably comical. It must go down as one of the worst cinematic adaptations of a book ever. How one could take such fabulous source material and produce such a hare-brained pr√©cis confounds me. This is a disgrace and an awful disservice to CNA. May Americanah fare better; Half of a Yellow Sun does not deserve this fate. Shame on this ""film"".",negative

Thank God I read the book. This movie version does not do Chimamanda's story justice at all.

Most of the actors did not fit the roles- Kainene was NOT supposed to be as...open, as she was in the movie, for instance. There was a reason they were written a certain way in the novel, and sadly, whoever produced this movie did not understand this.

Or, think of a movie that Karan Johar would produce, only make it hella cheesy and bad. The director (Indian, who apparently grew up in Nigeria all her life, also cameos in the movie) only seems to have overplayed all sorts of stereotypes, at least the Indian ones for sure. The Nigerian family isn't okay with an Indian groom, the Indian family isn't okay with a Nigerian wife. The director lady shows up and says ""People from other cultures are epic too"" and all the parents are okay with it? Like ""I'm depressed"" Friend: ""Don't be"". Me: ""Oh wow! My depression is gone! Thank you so much!"" It's like she decided to make a movie around that one line and didn't care how bad it was as long as the line made it in. The dialogue between the mothers was cringe-worthy. Failed opportunity for Women's Empowerment: The movie shows the Nigerian dad is upset that his daughter can't (?) look after his law firm and wants her to marry a Nigerian lawyer dude who'll take care of it. The daughter then solves newbie case, with some evidence (that a 15 yr-old would know to get) that her boyfriend requests from another dude because they're bros. So she's bad lawyer to begin with? You could have shown her do the job, but no! Had to get the dudes involved. And then, towards the end, you go on to say how epic of a lawyer she is based on this one case and how she should her dad's law firm? The other villain lady was a better fit to run the company IMO All that said and done, there's FINALLY a cultural exchange between the Indian mom and the Nigerian dad. Indian mom, supposedly progressive, asks for Dowry, ""Pay me because my son married your daughter"" she says. A woman, in 2021, asking for dowry - in a movie supposedly about cultural learning and feminism. WTH? The dad says ""No you're supposed to pay me because you're taking my daughter away"" The director, also a woman, couldn't find ANYTHING else to show from both the cultures? *smh* I can go on but that would be a waste of time.

Having watched other romcom Netflix Originals and grown up on Bollywood movies, i wasnt really expecting much.

It felt so forced and artificial. You could ""see"" the actors acting. First sign of a mediocre performance.

The worse was the script, it felt it was written by a student writer. The dialogues were contrived and very artificial.

There was NO CHEMISTRY with any cast members, it seemed like the entire thing was forced and not organic at all.

Wish they had a better writer and performers. Such an awkward movie! I wasn't expecting an Oscar level movie or performance, just your generic Hallmark level expectations, but this was sooo bad.

"Interesting premise, terrible script
carguychris23 June 2020
Netflix has recently been airing interesting foreign films, but they're really scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one. The obviously low-rent execution of this film doesn't bother me very much, but the horrid script and wildly uneven acting does.

This film is ostensibly about an airplane crash, but aside from the first 5 minutes and the last 20, it's actually a badly scripted and unevenly acted chamber drama with serious pacing problems. The plot aimlessly meanders between the personal lives of various characters, most of which are so uninteresting that the film feels far longer than its brief 75 minutes (a problem compounded by too many pointless establishing shots of aircraft taxiing - we already know we're at an airport!). The main actors do a good job, but the script often has them prattling aimlessly; minor characters are mere sketches, and many of the performances are cringe-worthy. Speaking of cringing, the attempts at comic relief are so unfunny that I'm unsure whether to even describe them as such, and it's obvious that the filmmakers knew almost nothing about how airliners actually operate.

"August the First on Reel 13

AUGUST THE FIRST, the Reel 13 Indie from September 13th, is problematic right from the get go. It's hard to dig your teeth into early on, particularly because the characters come at you fast and furious, introduced without any real establishing. I appreciate the attempt at efficiency, but without getting some sense of the characters we are dealing with (and their relationship to one another), nothing has any resonance and it's hard to follow what's going on. It's almost as if the first thirty minutes of the film are awash.

Eventually, the intelligent, careful viewer will start to understand the characters, their desires and motivations. By then, we are knee deep in an immature melodrama, with an accentuation on the ""melo"". The story revolves around the graduation party for Tunde, fresh off his college degree. For his party, Tunde surprises his family by inviting his estranged father from Africa to the party. The family is not pleased and then, yelling and tears naturally ensue. The way that director Lanre Olabisi piles on the pain causes the film to depart from the world of the real (the mother is a drunk and recovering from breast cancer, the sister is pregnant, the aunt is a slut who had an affair with the father ¬ñ get my drift?). Olabisi tries to combat that by employing an ultra-shaky hand-held technique to add a vitality to the film, but it doesn't remotely mesh with the soap opera leanings of the narrative. If Olabisi wanted to tell this story, I think he needed to embrace the melodrama a la Douglas Sirk and stylize it accordingly.

Then again, CRY FUNNY HAPPY, a film that I loved, has some melodramatic elements and also uses a hand-held camera. The big difference though is the acting. In CRY FUNNY HAPPY, the actors are raw and honest. Here, they seem untrained and are mostly over-the-top and not very believable (Sean Philips and Kerisse Hutchison are the strongest members of the ensemble as the older brother and sister of Tunde). The most intriguing thing about the film is the father character, who shows up at the party unexpectedly. In spite of the actor lumbering around in the character's shoes (D. Rubin Green does not seem very comfortable in the role, particularly in terms of movement ¬ñ though his accent is believable), he manages to come across as somewhat likable, even though the majority of the family distrusts him greatly. He is a very complex potential villain. His actions are interesting and seem to belie his statements and yet, his manner suggests that his intentions are pure and true. And so there is suspense in trying to determine why the father is really in town and if he really wants to reconnect. There are layers here and this is what the film needed to exploit even further.

However, as the film starts to build this interesting mystery amidst the schmaltz, it then turns around and betrays its audience by ending abruptly. I've always said that I don't need closure, but I do require an ending, if you are able to see the difference. There is not enough of a climax in AUGUST THE FIRST to earn the right to end when it did, which is just another of many amateur attributes that add up to make the film a great disappointment.",negative
"The movie left so much to be desired. Oloture jumping out the room window was only the first of several really crappy scenes in the movie.

This movie had an ambition to reflect human trafficking, but fails miserably",negative
"Awkward to watch

I didn't hate the film but there wasn't much plot and clearly made on a very low budget.

There are moments where they are filming in public, where passersby are staring right in to the camera which is a big blooper considering it's meant to be a film. The audio frequently dips meaning you can't hear what they are saying. The acting from Okon (Ime Bishop Umoh) is awkward and annoying to watch, with his unnecessary facial expressions. There points where English characters are speaking, but their lines are clearly written by a Nigerian because native Brits would not speak like that. And the majority of the British characters look like they were recruited from a Job centre as they have zero acting skills.

"This movie was a movie that had great potential. A directorial debut of the Famous Nigerian Genevieve, packed with star studded Nigerian Names from Phyno, to Pete edochie. It also Had really fantastic production value, however that's as far as positives go. One thing that a good movie needs above all else is ""story"". the story usually sets actors up for fantastic pe formances, can usually be the thing to sell a movie. However, this failed to be anything other than boring. It had no logical flow. It was trying to do a lot of things, like develop a love interest for Genevieve, set her up as a hardworking female, however it offers nothing in terms of bringing that to life. There should have been more connections to the characters, like what does Lionheart mean ?? Who exactly are these characters. It feels very empty and quickly put together. Building on from that, another thing that makes movie so terrible is, because the story is terrible the actors cannot live up to their potential. They're stuck in a bad story, so there's nothing to immerse themselves in. The film also has terrible writing which also contributes to the actor's terrible performances. I don't know who wrote this but it was really off the mark for writing. Some of the dialogue was so superficial and empty. They threw in some inspirational words here and there to try and do soemthing but it had no effect because they hadn't prepared for it properly. There was also a serious lack of research witht the writing. When you borrow 950 million naira,which is basically 2.6 million dollars, no company takes that kind of loan and pays back fully in a year. People pay interests on that loan, so that really messed up the story and writing. Also was the evil coworker a board member ?? What was he doing at those meetings ?? And how can a company which has a board be unaware of a 2.6 million dollar loan. It's jsust not possible, that's not how business works. It feels as if real life was bent to fit the terrible narrative this movie was trying to tell. The only positive of this movie is production value. The cinematography is average holly wood standard, although it falters a lot. It's evident of a quite low budget Hollywood movie. It's netflix quality, let me put it that way in terms of original content. However, it still needs to improve. I think Genevieve needs to go on a masters in directing from a good film school to understand how to properly direct, it is really important she does that. In conclusion, this was a movie that could have been groundbreaking in terms of Nigeria's first original Netflix content. However m perhaps shockingly, seeing as it was bought by Netflix, it was absolutely poor. And writing, bad story, bad acting. I can only congratulate the production value of this.",negative

Also, the pregnant wife's friend whatever, I wanted to slap her so hard in the face. And OMG, the wife's screams. Annoying than Tara Reid in the horror movies she's in (Urban Legend) for example.

"Nollywood exists because it appeals to a certain demographic that wants to see something they don't get from the American film industry. With the success of Nollywood films, it shows that Nigerians want relationship mellow drama, spiritual and religious themes and grandiose theatrics. As the popularity has increased, they upgraded from no budget, shoddy filmmaking to low budget with better camera work and lighting. That's what I found with Frank Rajah Arase's new film Iyore. It's your typical Nollywood movie, cheating, ancestral folklore, bad acting but with real production value.

Iyore tells the story of a sacrificial virgin and her lover back in the early days of the Benin Kingdom, running away and now in the present day they're ancestors are dealing with similar transgression. It's quite difficult to write a summary because there are so many characters with motivations I couldn't understand. The connection between the past and present wasn't clear at all. Some of the lead performances were decent but most laughably over the top. I maybe would have enjoyed it more if gathered with friends, making fun of the poorly written dialogue and pregnant pauses but instead I was in a dark theater bored out of my mind.

Highlight: there is one legitimately funny scene of a villager bribing the prince which was well heightened and earned my laughs.

Unfortunately it's exactly like some other Nigerian films I've seen: a lot of standing around and talking in semi-empty rooms, you can't hear what the people are saying as the microphone is located in another room or possibly another city altogether and in general it's just dull.

It's funny at some points, yes, especially in the beginning, and it's interesting to see what kind of beliefs people hold in other parts of the world but otherwise watching this was as fun as going to a dentist.

"Though the cinematography looks professional, don't let this film fool you. It's a disaster. Starting with incredibly poor writing, the bonkers plot brings none of the horrors it is constantly talking about and as a result, there's a large exposition problem that further emphasizes the atrocious dialogue. Most of the performances aren't good to begin with but the lead, Swanky J.K.A., is laughably bad. It's very confused and incredibly boring.",negative

"I‚Äôm not quite sure who this movie is made for. On one hand the film‚Äôs themes are clearly intended for children, more specifically little girls, as it deals with the importance of education especially in heavily patriarchal societies. On the other hand the film contains quite graphic displays of child abuse with an incredibly unnecessary rape scene involving a twelve year old girl which rivals Megan is Missing (2009) in levels of pure disgust. 

The entire production is very amateurish, the audio being the worst offender. The ADR is very noticeable as we can constantly hear the background noise of the room it was recorded in. Oftentimes it sounds as though the characters are miles apart when they instead are having a conversation in the same room. This film has one of the worst soundtracks that I‚Äôve ever heard. When it isn‚Äôt playing an out of place pop song, it uses some of the most generic stock music that I‚Äôve ever heard which often has the opposite of the intended effect. It rarely fits and sometimes just serves to over-explain what each character is feeling.

The weirdest thing on display here is how the film attempts to explain why the protagonist‚Äôs father doesn‚Äôt want her to get an education. Typically in these types of movies the explanation is deeply rooted in cultural traditions which is perfectly fine as it allows for a larger audience to connect with it. But in this film her father doesn‚Äôt want her to get an education because her mother had gotten one and then turned into a terrible woman. This event is portrayed in multiple flashbacks which show her to be caring and loving before going to school and then changing into an unpleasant woman afterwards. Since we know so little about this character and the only change in her life is that she is now going to school, the film implies that it is the education that changed her attitude which, bizarrely, goes against its very themes. This type of contradiction is actually surprisingly very commonplace in the film. Other than our main character, the school kids are all portrayed as quite stupid and are unable to answer any question that the teacher throws at them no matter how simple. It is shown later that no student was able to get even a decent score on their exams. So the question is, why would you make a film about the importance of education and then proceed to portray it as something which either doesn‚Äôt work or turns people into insufferable elitists?

"f you watched Chief Daddy: Going For Broke on its New Year Day release on Netflix and immediately thought it to be a contender for the worst movie of the year, know that the fault isn't yours; its Ebony Life's, Netflix Naija's, Executive Producer Mo Abudu's, Director Niyi Akinmolayan's, and every other person that thought it wise to kick-off our New Year celebrations with this premium disaster of a movie.

Chief Daddy (2018) was flat, but this sequel, Going For Broke, sets such new lows for the pointless franchise that it makes the first one look good.

Chief Daddy 2, in many ways, and like many other overhyped movies from Nollywood in recent memory, felt like a train of Instagram skits slapped onto each other. It's unnecessarily long, disjointed, and pointless. Saddest part is, it doesn't take long after the opening credits roll in for viewers to realize how pointless this almost 2 hours movie is going to be.

A non-existent story, mediocre screenplay, shitty direction behind the camera, and little to no consistency with almost all the characters from the first movie are some of the obvious problems that bedevilled this sequel no one asked for.

Chief Daddy: Going For Broke is a disaster, and that's putting it mildly. Ebony Life had quickly go back to the drawing board and come up with something good because they really need a win right now. Working with Netflix is great for the brand, but disappointing fans like this, in an industry where the standards are already pretty low, doesn't bode well for anyone, even for the ""biggest movie studio"" in Nigeria.

There was a ""song"" near the beginning and I couldn't tell if it was supposed to all be one song with dialogue in-between or if they were just switching songs rapidly. It was that disorganized. The various sections sounded totally unrelated to one another until the last one sounded like the first one again and I was like, ""...wait...so was this all one song?"" Just embarrassing. I compare it to Disney because the style of the songs seems like it's trying to be like Disney songs. Except that one time they try to do some acoustic rock song style thing?

And then there's the whole princess story. But it's incredibly poorly written. The dialogue is garbage, the premise is unoriginal, the acting is horrendous, and the plot drags on and on because of unnecessary shitty songs. I was going to turn this off about 20 minutes in, but chose to finish it 100% so that I could write a review about how terrible it is.

I was surprised that I actually recognized one of the actors, Hakeem Kae-Kazim, and I feel that it's only fair that I mention that he's the only one who doesn't suck at acting, but he isn't great either and I blame this on the directing because I know he can act.

Pulling their resources and bytes of creativity together, they braved the odds to make their very own movie. For name recognition; they called in favors to secure appearances-by-way-of-charity from Big-hearted Toyin Aimakhu Abraham (whose antics were the only thing that got any visible positive reactions from the crowd) and an obviously irritated Helen Paul, whom judging by her demeanor, we suspect was either blackmailed into appearing or was acting on forlorn credit.

"One-way traffic plot, average movie at best.

Lionheart was a movie that generated a lot of buzz in the Nollywood industry. Considering the international support it got from Netflix, I was particularly excited to see how this movie went.

From the get go the movie wears an indigenous look with local scenery and an instant banter in local language.

However, it was one way traffic from there onwards, as the movie progressed.

The plot is totally bare and overly predictable, and I'm still reeling from the shock of this being a comedy film.

However, I still applaud the production quality of this film as it was great and a large chunk of the headline cast delivered on their script-save for Peter Okoye who was highly disappointing.

For a directorial debut, one can only applaud the courage of Genevieve in pulling off this movie.

On a final note, you are not guaranteed to have a good time watching this, and do not expect any fireworks.",negative

"My first Nigerian movie

For the past several years, I have come across a number of reports telling about how the country of Nigeria has a successful domestic film industry. While that fact definitely intrigued me, I was unable to find any Nigerian movies available for me to look at until I stumbled upon this one on Netflix. To be honest, I was expecting something pretty crudely made, and to a large degree this is true. While there are some pretty good composed shots and/or direction that indicate that at times some real effort was being made by the filmmakers, the movie has far more shortcomings. The cinematography is unimpressive, there's very little in the way of production values, and the acting by many of the performers is amateurish. Actually, I might have been able to forgive all that had the movie's biggest problem did not exist, that being that it's far too long (121 minutes in length) and far too slowly paced. This is a story that really needed to be cut down either at the script stage or when the footage was being edited. There is a twist towards the end that's a little interesting (despite my ability to somewhat predict it before it unfolded), but it's too little and too late to make it worth sitting through a story that's too long and too slow. Still, if you have heard of Nigerian cinema and are curious about experiencing a sample of it, I've just told you of one possible accessible choice.",negative
"I'm sorry, I just didn't like it.

This film is a great example of some incredible archive footage ruined by a boring, mediocre and incoherent film in between.

Yes, I have read the book. I wasn't expecting a literal screen translation of the book, as the book covers a vast array of characters, but I did expect the essence of it to be retained.

It wasn't.

The film follows the lives of twin sisters Olanna (Thandie Newton) and Kainene (Akina Noni Rose) right after Nigeria gets its independence from the British and through to the Biafran war, as the Igbo people struggle to establish an independent republic. The film (similar to the book) tries to follow the lives of these 2 affluent young women, their relationships with men and with one another set against a significant historical event in Nigeria.

I went to watch this film specifically to support African Cinema and exited about a Nigerian Director making a film with a strong cast. I was bitterly disappointed with the lazy result.

Firstly the performances; Chiwetel Ejiofor is ever earnest in his role as Olanna's lover Odenigbo. He is OK, not offensive and gives a similar performance as he did in 12 years a slave. Thandie Newton is horrific. She has literally two expressions. I like to think its to do with the bad direction, someone should have told her she's over-acting .

The worst and best performance came from Odenigbo's Mother played by Onyeka Onwenu. What can I say. The best is that she was very entertaining, funny and a joy to watch. What made it the worst was that it belonged to a different film. A film I would have preferred to watch by the way. Her performance added a quality of a soap opera to the film. Anika had the strongest performance among them and deserves a mention for it. 

The film has two parts, the first comes across as a cheap soap opera and the second, a cheap action movie. Choices that were made baffled me. Scenes played out that were pointless and didn't add much to the plot, making the first half plod along longer than it should have. The second half was riddled with inconsistencies and poor editing. Characters were introduced just as quickly as they were killed off. I am not sure why it was important to illustrate on a map were everyone was, that added nothing.

But the biggest problem with the film is that it lacked a director, a proper director. There wasn't anyone keeping the actors believable, controlling the movement of the camera, having a coherent edit or keeping tabs on the horrendous sound score.

Unbelievably the producers also produced Constant Gardener and should have known better than this. How can you allow an inexperienced Director to helm such a significant film? It's arrogant and irresponsible.

I am African (yes, I know it's a continent), I applaud any one trying to make our stories for an audience outside of the continent but this effort was so poor that I had to write about it. We can do much better than this.",negative
" Worst adaptation ever

I am currently studying the book for my literature program, so I thought I would watch the movie just to visualize things and unfortunately I wish I had not done that because now I cannot unsee it Olanna is described as a bit curvy, Kainene has a cold personality but opposite is the case in the film. Ugwu appears for a few seconds, as if he is some extra character, the Kano massacre was so vague ,the tragedies that took place were just summarized, instead the director made it all about Olanna and Kainene and their man problems. The movie lacks the depth that the novel holds and has ruined the novel's prestige,to be honest . We don't even get to see Ugwu's transition from a naive rural boy to an almost well groomed young man, now literate and able to write a novel.My advice, go buy the book and read it instead because the visuals you will have when reading are much better than this movie.",negative

"Swallow addresses deep societal issues on a surface level

Swallow is a period piece that takes place in the 1980s and the movie ensures you know this. It addresses a lot of issues like misogyny, the Nigerian patriarchy, gangs and of course drugs. However, there were a plethora of issues with this film. For example, scenes dragged on for too long with zero impact that completely takes you out of the experience. Set pieces were non-existent, making the film seem like an exaggerated stage play. The acting was decent unfortunately the story didn't give much to work with. The biggest problem for swallow is that it tries to address all these societal issues without taking any of it to heart, which ultimately leads to a boring finale that does not stick with you much after the movie's ending.

Lines are forcibly and unnaturally delivered, while simultaneously being a very weird mix of wannabe hip lingo and unfitting obscure words and sayings. The only decent performance is by Jimmy Jean-Louis and even that is only decent at best.

The only reason this isn't rated lower is because the cinematography is actually rather gorgeous. Scenes, lighting and coloring is very a esthetically pleasing and on a technical level the movie is on par with some of the better movies.

If you are going to have an english movie - make sure all of the characters can speak english please. Otherwise keep it in its original dialect and simply have subtitles.

My favourite character was also the most incompetent - Sergeant Afonja. A very likeable buffoon - I am never sure if that is what the director is going for or if its by complete accident.

Outside the confusion, judging from the little we could make of the story from the audio, 'The Perfect Picture' might actually have turned out good.

However, by the time we do see her crying, we can't hear her cry any longer. Instead, we hear the dialogue of the coming scene.

"""They deported me from the USA""

Some things are universal, wherever you go you will find a film student producing a self-righteous movie about how difficult it is to produce movies, and Green White Green is the most typical example of this archetype.

The film features all of the hallmarks of a poorly produced student film: royalty-free music, unprofessional and generally very bad actors, some inspired visuals but generally poorly composed cinematography, dreadful editing, and a clear lack of confidence in their own creative vision that the film's narrative must be meta and ironic in some sense. If I wanted to see this calibre of filmmaking I would have attended the screening of films from production students at my own university, which I did not. The only distinction between this and the films that my peers produce is the slight novelty of this being a Nigerian production however that largely feels like a wasted opportunity. Themes of class and wealth are certainly discussed but are massively overlooked. For all the empty platitudes the film preaches about wealth inequality there are clear instances wherein the film exhibits its own prejudices towards impoverished people, be it the unfavourable light the rival group of lads are shown in because of their background, blatant xenophobia towards people of the impoverished nations (particularly other African nations and the middle east) and generally holding the West (particularly Northern Europe and the United States) to high regard. This is unsurprising from a director who was taught filmmaking at NYU (New York University). In interviews director Abba Makama speaks at length about how the film represents the different ethnic groups of Nigeria and puts homegrown, indigenous African artistry on a pedestal, when the film itself has such an overt occidental vision and hardly ever properly explores themes of race and poverty. As virtuous and important as he believes his film to be, Green White Green is just a dime a dozen not only in terms of its typical film student approach but also it being lost in a sea of Nollywood movies, a vast number of which more adequately explore themes of race and Nigerian nationality. Remove those themes and this is just as generic a movie that anyone with a couple years of formal education could produce.

And it comes with the territory of a student film that there might be some inspired elements. A clear admiration for the canon of film that came before it, some ambitious cinematography, a fairly decent script, again these things are not uncommon of a student film but aid in making Green White Green at least engaging to a certain extent.",negative

"Citation is a hefty film, which may even prove too much for certain people, it handles a lot of serious issues which ultimately deserve a better effort behind the camera involving a more sensitive approach. 

The first notable flaw is the film‚Äôs length, it‚Äôs 2 and a half hours which proved tedious clarified by a number of scenes which added nothing to the narrative. The film has a lot of tonal issues, as previously mentioned the sheer heft of the film‚Äôs themes were not dealt with well or consistently, the expositional scenes feel like they were written for a TV soap and in contrast some of the flashbacks were clearly confounding in tone. The film is all over the place when it comes to narrative, they obviously couldn‚Äôt  figure out what way to tell the story and they visibly struggled to decide what to include in the film, a lot of non-relevant material is brought up. 

The performances are mostly fine, but the editing made it hard to follow any character for long enough to feel anything towards them other than fore-frontal empathy or hatred. The filmmaking is a definitive letdown, the sound mixing and editing stand out as particularly poor, it often sounds like they allowed children inside of the editing room and the dialogue scenes are often hard to hear due to bad mixing. The score is really bad, there‚Äôs a scene which is incredibly hard to watch but the score sounds like something used in a fight sequence, and it lessened the heftiness of the scene. 

It‚Äôs a film with so many obvious flaws that it‚Äôs hard to find positives, there isn‚Äôt many within the craft, but I have an admiration for what they were trying to do, unfortunately the people working on the production didn‚Äôt have the proficiency or competence to handle the deep thematic elements of the film and some of the filmmaking is quite simply terrible.

"Can't say this movie makes sense
Sure, the production value isn't good and you can tell in the first 15 minutes, but the story and writing just don't make sense
This movie isn't about a heist or what these guys actually do, it's like if someone made a movie just to be able to look at attractive girls and drive nice cars
There's a fine movie here somewhere, but the writer who I guess is also one if the main characters and is a popular Nigerian comedian needed to do better...but there were some funny scenes I guess

Watching this after the second one didn't explain anything except two really strange starts to relationships...all the second one did was introduce new characters in a way that made it seem I should watch the first one to have an idea of who they were.

"I haven't read Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Orange Prize-winning novel, though I am aware of the consensus that it is, to quote Harold Bloom, reet good an' all. It's been called the African Gone With the Wind, and considering the racial politics of the American Gone With the Wind that's a necessary corrective. The main frustration of this film adaptation is that it's not hard at all to see the good in it, but it's just so fitful and haphazardly realised.

The first problem is that it's telling a story which seems to me to be more suitable for a miniseries, or at least a Christopher Nolan-length film, at just under an hour and fifty minutes. The compression makes it harder to care about the stories - why should we invest in the marriage of two characters when we've gone from them meeting to him cheating on her in about fifteen or twenty minutes? It also creates some moments of bathos, for example, when joyous newsreel showing the creation of the independent nation of Biafra cuts immediately into Anika Noni Rose gloomily declaring that there'll be a war soon. Not that there's no possible character reason why she wouldn't feel as happy as the people in the archive footage - but the suddenness!

That newsreel was also a big problem for me. Half of a Yellow Sun has as its background the attempt by the southern region of Nigeria to become an independent nation, and the vicious civil war that ensued. It's a story that needs to be told if we're to understand the aftermath of colonialism on African nations - but it's also one that few Westerners know. Writer and director Biyi Bandele fills in the background with newsreel footage and a narrator doing his best old-fashioned BBC presenter voice. I felt there was an opportunity missed here to ironize that dynamic, to create a stronger counterpoint between how this war was reported by the European former colonial powers and what it was like to live through it.

As it stands, the most immediate and hard-hitting thing in Half of a Yellow Sun is Thandie Newton's lead performance, one of the rare moments when this actress has been given something worthy of her talent and charisma. Her wrenchingly performed anguish ties the emotional and political stories together even as Bandele struggles to. Made exclusively within the Nigerian film industry at the urging of Adichie, Half of a Yellow Sun is a film of impeccable good intentions and good taste at the expense of anger, sweep and passion. It's watchable and enjoyable - but maybe it shouldn't be.

"Thank God I read the book.

I have consumed nearly all of Ms Adichie. While I was 'Literature in English' subject teacher in 2012, 'Purple Hibiscus' and 'Half of A Yellow Sun' were in the prescribed literary texts list. Thus, in 2012, my students and I ate Half of A Yellow Sun, even every word and punctuation. Fast forward to 2014 when we geared for the Nigerian release of the movie adaptation, hopes were dashed however when the movie received a tentative ban from the government who feared that it (Half of A Yellow Sun Movie) might incite violence and start a second civil war. ""Ok, this movie must be the s**t"" but no it wasn't.

You can only only imagine how weak and watery the movie script was. But wait, you don't need to imagine, the movie shows it all. I tortured my brain to see the movie 'til the end, and that was because I had read the book. What about people who hadn't read that fine novel? They were served trash. I know a film adaptation cannot do justice to a book of almost 500 pages but Biyi Bandele could have avoided the pitfalls. I'm sure he was awestruck by the novel that he felt he owed CNA a duty to copy and paste everything from the novel into the film ( but he should have been warned). Better still he should have used a 'based upon' approach rather than this verbatim adaptation, and we still would be OK.

Getting to the nucleus of what a book is truly about is the cue to an adaptation. I'm not sure Biyi knew that. Maybe now he knows that some scenes were not needed in the movie. However, thank God I read the book.",negative
"awful rendition of a very good novel

the only redeeming features of this film are that the use of colour is beautiful in places and there are a few good Nigerian character actors who give some engaging performances. 

But oh my goodness if you've read the novel you will be stunned at how badly it has been brought to the screen. I noticed in the opening credits that Aidichie the author did not write the screenplay and it shows.

The acting is, by and large unconvincing, but what really weakens the novel is the very simplistic way that the complexities of the Biafran crisis are presented to the viewer. There's almost no way for someone with no background of the events concerned to make any sense of it all. And the film almost ignores the horrific atrocities, the atrocious famine and the way that the crisis was made worse by almost the entire political world turning a blind eye for four long years.

The editing is woeful with the plot taking place in several locations interspersed with archive BBC news footage. The scenes are all confined to static sets with few exceptions. Those exceptions are badly filmed 'action' shots with 1980s A-Team special effects. 

Oh, and then it ended. Just like that.

Very very disappointing. Don't waste money on this at the cinema. Spend it instead on the excellent novel which I fear many will now not read because they think it will be as bad as the film.",negative

"In the style of a 1985 soap opera
Has the look and feel of a soap opera from 1985 except with fewer twists, less campiness, no surprises, less suspense and a very long, drawn out plot.

On the plus side, the acting is really good and all the actors seemed believable in their characters. Plus, I love the fact that the creators didn't take themselves too seriously, adding humor throughout, especially in the first half. To me the plot isn't dark enough or gory enough to be horror, it's more like family drama with some wannabe horror moments touching on faux-occult.

The camerawork and musical score are good, but nowadays that's table stakes for most movies, and not something to brag about.

The biggest drawback is that, at two hours, this movie could have been edited down more efficiently to about an hour. Considering there are zero surprises, and the plot is predictable, turning this into two hours literally ruins the movie. Had it been much shorter it would have been far more interesting and the same story could have been told.",negative

STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

In the 1960s and 70s, poor Nigerian families would loan their children to British couples while they went away to try and attain a better life. Ingrid (Kate Beckinsale) and her husband are one such couple, taking in Enitan (Damson Idris), from Femi (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and his wife, who struggles to blend in. As a young man in the early 1980s, he has difficulty coming to terms with his own identity, and after a run in with Levi (John Dagleish) and his gang of skinheads, descends into a downward spiral of destruction that threatens to rip everything apart.

With the rise of racist ideology rising back up in society at the moment, what could now be seen as a period piece in the shape of the early 1980s, serves as a fitting template to set a story, at a time when it was a lot more blatant and uncensored. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, a rising star after last year's Dark Money (despite having an unpronounceable name!), here showcases his writing and directing debut, as well as providing an integral supporting role, in a tale he probably had some first hand experience of.

It's a startling practice, that I like probably many others, wasn't aware went on, and it certainly provides riveting potential for some powerful drama. Lead star Idris has an effective presence, and delivers a strong performance, with some reliable, sturdy support from the likes of Beckinsale, Dagleish, and of course Agbaje himself. And there's some suitably unsettling depictions of racist violence that get under your skin. Sadly, it's all executed in a completely uninvolving and ineffective manner, never getting you to feel for any of these characters, or flesh them out in any meaningful way.

Agbaje obviously has a passion for film, and depicting accounts of racial aggravation/tension in his adopted home. Hopefully, this is just a little blip on the path to something greater. **",negative
"There Was An Interesting Story Here - This Isn't It

In the early 1990s while dinning in an African restaurant in Los Angeles, I bumped into Adewale - he'd heard my English accent as I spoke with my West African wife and struck up a conversation. We exchanged numbers and agreed to meet up again having mentioned our mutual interest in the movie industry. He was just breaking into Hollywood and I fancied myself a screenwriter. Adewale shared the phenomenon of 'farming the children,' recounting his own experiences under that abdication of parental responsibility. Since we're both Londoners of similar age we shared stories of our youth in the late seventies. I spent that period of my life deeply immersed in the British punk rock scene, itself a hub for the skinhead and mod revivals. I have no recollection of Adewale mentioning his peculiar involvement in a gang of ultra-violent white racist skinheads during this era; perhaps shame dictated he avoid speaking of such an astonishing episode in his life.What I do know is that his movie's portrayal of nineteen-seventies white working-class English people and of the subcultures of their children is absurdly cartoonish and trite. The neo-Nazi, psycho-skin trope has been a reliable contemporary Hammer Horror-like monster which 'Farmed' disappointingly enjoins. It's unfortunate since this era's youth is redolent with story lines worth telling - and worth telling accurately. The working-class English who lived during that time are a kaleidoscope of characters and attitudes worthy of honest examination as are their interactions with immigrants and their English-born children. To portray them as generally bigoted, oafish, humourless and hyper-aggressive is to indulge a stereotype no less insulting than the black pimp or the inscrutable Asian. Nigerian farmed children have unique and lamentable stories, but for me this film failed to capture the emotional complexity and profundity of the arrangement due to heavy-handed poetic license of the writer/director.",negative

"Impressive but not so Captivating nor Thrilling

2010's much talked about movie Ij√©: The Journey was released on DVD a few days ago so i decided to check it out and see what the hype was all about- You're about to read my review. Nigerian movies have come a long way from the ""microwave era"" when movies were made within a 1wk or so (not that it's not still happening) and Ij√© is proof that something good can come out of a well put together script.

Ij√©: The Journey stars two of Nigeria's heavy weights in the movie industry Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde and Genevieve Nnaji as the lead characters and it co-stars a number of foreign actors who managed to spice up the movie.

The movie tells the story of two sisters Anya (Omotola Jalade- Ekeinde) and Chioma (Genevieve Nnaji) who have an unbreakable bond of loyalty and the power of the human spirit which ultimately gets tested over the course of the movie.

When Anya, the eldest of the two, vows to chase her dreams of glamour in the Hollywood Hills, her younger sister, Chioma‚Äîwarns her of the dark side of the American Dream. Now, years later, and in a world away from the life she knew, Anya is charged with the murder of three men, one of them her powerful husband. Chioma travels to her sister's side to battle not only a flawed justice system with the aid of a young and disillusioned attorney, but the very notion of ""truth"" as the cultural values of two worlds collide.

Samuel Tilsen and Chineze Anyaene who are credited as the writers of this movie could have did a good job mashing different elements of drama flicks centered around a murder and trial while. The movie could have been 20mins or more shorter if a number of scenes had not be stretched or had been completely omitted but at the end of the day it all came down to what Chineze Anyaene the director wanted.

There were times when watching the movie was a lot like watching one of those Televista series like ""When You Were Mine"" which i don't say in a good way and the sound in the background was little too much as i would have preferred if not every scene had some sort of music playing in the background and thus give the pictures life of their own. Still on music, Asa crooning her hit track ""Awe"" as the opening soundtrack was alright initially but then it started dragging on and was used a second time in the movie (i hope she got paid) making it tiring.

For my second Nigerian movie in 2012, it sure was better than Mr and Mrs (Joseph Benjamin & Nse Ikpe Etim) where they kept zooming in on the actors and objects in the room in almost all the scenes making you wonder if you were watching an interview put together by an amateur instead of a movie expected to be enjoyed. The scenes in Ij√© flowed properly and for someone not looking to analyze every single scene it came out commendable.

I decided to go in on the actors in the movie as the last part of my review as i was expecting more from the ""Nollywood Heavyweights"" Omotola & Genevieve but instead their acting wasn't so impressive but worth praising when compared to Ulrich Que's acting in the movie. Ulrich played the lawyer (Jalen Turner) in the movie and i have to say his acting was laughable (hopefully they didn't pay him much for the movie). Not all the actors were unconvincing in their roles and one of those that managed to deliver was the inmate ""Libby"" played by Diana Yekinni.

While Ij√©: The Journey (with a budget of about $2.5 million) isn't your everyday Nollywood film and had a good story-line, i certainly won't be watching this one a second time as the movie wasn't captivating nor was it thrilling and i could easily leave my seat with the movie playing and not ask ""What did i miss?"" the moment i returned.",negative

"Another good potential ruined by bad writing

If you don't have a good script to start with, don't make the movie.

This is a historic drama. As one watches, the potential for the story is there. Some people will claim this has bad acting, but remember where this is filmed and don't expect Hollywood mannerisms from that part of the world. The acting is true to that culture.

The writing and story though... that was pretty poor, as was the directing and choreography. Fake fighting, punches being visibly pulled, swords slowly and barely connecting, the ""sword to the side"" trope, etc. Not that I care to see realistic battles, but there are non-gory ways to present battles that aren't obviously fake.

Some of the story is presented well. The pain and suffering of slavery. The subterfuge of betrayals. But surprisingly, the main character herself is about as two-dimensional as they come. The King was a more interesting presentation. It seems a great deal was left out of the story, but it's hard to tell what since I haven't studied that part of history. Basically, the story just falls flat with a really lazy ending.

I'm being generous in giving it 4 stars... and I do that mainly because of the unusual setting and the fact that it was moderately interesting all the way through. But when it comes to the end of the movie one realizes what a let-down the whole thing is. As far as a cinematic presentation and presentable story line goes, this fails to deliver.",negative
"A good story ruined by a bad screenplay

This is a weird one. I can tell that it's a good story with several intrigues, but most of the scenes were terrible, and the fighting scenes in particular. The acting goes from stage actors to ""I tried my best as an amateur"".

What's surprising is the quality of the photo. Really sharp images with great color grading, and I can say the same thing about the score. I can tell that there is some budget behind the movie, with the costumes and all - the movie even got some descent enough CGI.

If a capable person would had gotten their hands on the script, and written a good screenplay, this would actually be something I would recommend to people. If a great screen play, then this would be a must watch. I had to watch the movie with the notion of what it could have been; with dreamy sequences, dramatic closeups, and voice overs telling thoughts over the scenery playing out in front of my eyes.

If you crave for a Nigerian fantasy flick, with inspiration from real events(?), then watch this one. Otherwise, just watch some Nollywood movie instead. At least you will have a laugh.",negative
"Can a movie be bad, but important?

Ok, this movie wasn't a ""great."" There was a low budget feel, the acting and script were mediocre. Yet, interracial and intercultural romances, especially with non-European leads, need to be told. So, there wasn't a great love story here... you didn't fall in love with the characters because they were shallow; there were definite plot flaws (like why a character would take a certain opportunity offered at the end of the movie when it didn't correspond with previously stated goals and ideals.) The dancing was incredibly poor (serious actors take classes and study the art form to look at least passably convincing or hire a body double). But at least someone represented an intercultural love story, perhaps opened the way for discussion, understanding, curiosity, interest, between people of different backgrounds. So, I support this movie... and I'll forget about it entirely in a few days and never think of it again.",negative
"Production and soundtrack ruined a good story

The story was interesting, the acting good, and the end provided sufficient closure. However, the production was awful. The picture needed to be clearer and the sound much better. At time I couldn't hear it well enough, but turning it up meant causing it to sound like screeching. All of these production problems seem to be common for Nigerian movies. The soundtrack ... definite overuse of the music (another common fault with Nigerian films), and too many long shots of nothing. For example, the camera focusing on feet walking ... at most, this should only be for a few seconds. But again, a common problem with these films. I would happily buy this movie (instead of just borrowing) if the production were more professional. No/low budget is no excuse. Technical training must be done to give these stories their due. Blood Sisters (1 & 2) was well written. Pretty much all of the dialogue was meaningful too. I mean, not a lot of wasteful or redundant words. I've seen quite a few Nigerian films, and this one is the best so far. It *moved* me. it also contained all the good elements that make a good, entertaining story. I'd give it a 10 if it weren't for the production problems and waste of film on useful footage (a car driving, a person walking, etc. ... Just too much time spent on these shots).",negative

The cinematographer has overdone the close ups and fade aways out of focus. And what is it with starting scenes focusing away from the action (a foot here, a finger there) and letting the audience guess what is going on from noise alone? The best scene, when Ayodele learns the truth about his son, is one time when fading of view and sound are truly effective. Many of the other seem contrived",negative

"LACKED INDEPTH
teamo-797268 October 2020
LACKED INDEPTH 4/10: except this movie was based exactly on a true-life story, if no? here's my take: The movie is a typical cliche Nigerian movie. 'the characters/roles were projected with shallowness' Ehi, an undercover prostitute, seems to 'chicken out' when it's time to act her role but after the incident with sir Philips, she carried her two legs to go to Europe in a space of weeks. Really? When they just needed to burst the trafficker's activity. The movie is a kind that should give insight, spark discussions, give lessons on how to handle oneself in life/critical situations ;but just like many Nigerian movies...nothing really like that, for instance - after the situation with sir Philips and Ehi went to the hospital, they should have been able to get semen sample from ehi to indict/prosecute sir Philips ,they can even include that she lost the case or she went to women affairs and the case was taken up, but there was nothing like that , typical Nigerian movie(they don't teach people sense). The character building was poor, so no emotional attachment. This movie should be a sensitive one that should put people on edge for solid 120mins if they've put it together well enough but it's was just another 'Eeyah movie' (it's a pity) So there was not one single police dept/officer they (journalist) could work with? From the entire NPF in Lagos? In 2020? Really? So no other security agency - private/local/traditional in Lagos? Just the way nollywood won't consult with doctors while writing a script, its likely they didn't consult with the police/security Dept. Nigeria movie will show a Doctor tell a patient that their heart ,kidneys ,liver are failing and the person even need kidney transplant and that same patient/person would have the strength to jump up and be shouting 'Ewo' ,like really? Someone's systems are shutting down and the person still have so much strength. So as a journalist he couldn't even influence the NPF in 2020. That means the rest of the populace is DOOMED. So according to the movie Ehi was a novice, doesn't mean the person she was working with was too. So, her boss placed her in that type of situation without an emergency escape plan? it's like they don't even understand the in-depth of prostitution and human trafficking. Nollywood should stop feeding us breast milk instead of party jollof with moi-moi and nkwobi to step down. The rescue attempt was poor, the regular police coming at the last minute that Nollywood has been feeding us for ages, no gun battle . imagine a gun battle with the traffickers and still losing the girls or some of them. No attempt in communicating with the border in 2020? Really? I wasn't expecting a happy ending; ending was ok.

The acting is ok, but the script is quite poor. Good seeing Danny Glover again! I was disappointed with this movie, was hoping for more, especially with a nice change from big Hollywood! üòî",negative

...sums up the current two 10/10 reviews.

This is African amateur writer, director and editor Akinyemi Sebastian Akinropo's first ever dabble in filmmaking, and it really does show.

The ""based on a true story"" is a very good and interesting story that needed to be told, but the execution of the storytelling was awful. It's started fairly decent, but Akinropo's editing was horrible with scenes dropping in out of nowhere and cutting out too soon. I call it ""blender editing"".

The pacing was fairly decent for the length of the screenplay, but the 100 min runtime was too long for the story being told. There were tons of plot and technical issues and many irregularities with the fluidity of the screenplay. This could have easily, and should have been, trimmed down to 80-85 mins tops.

The directing wasn't that bad for a first-timer, although some scenes were really badly directed and filmed that seemed 1980's dad-on-the-camcorder quality. The acting was actually not bad at all - for amateur actors that also had no direction from Akinropo. The sound was bad, probably from the lack of boom mics. The score and cinematography were adequate and the set location and landscape was great.

Filmmakers have to start somewhere, right, but I wish Akinropo had at least ran his script by a seasoned writer for some edits, and/or and experienced editor. That could've made this film much better. You can basically fast-fwd some scenes and not miss a thing. The true story needed to be told, and I'm glad it was, but wish it was told better.",negative
"Really awkward

I can't finish watching this movie. The timing is so awkward. It reminds me of a daytime soap opera. I kept yelling, ""Do something! Say something!""

Four stars because, believe it or not, I've watched much worse.",negative
"A flawed first feature film, but it shows a great deal of promise",negative
"Slow-moving Nigerian drama about sexual harassment, assault",negative
Only in broad Nollywood comedy mode does it feel truly convincing.,negative
"There's not a great deal wrong with the story, but it is presented in a too simplistic manner, especially the dialogue which often feels like it is trying to explain events to children. It's more than idealistic ending also doesn't feel genuine. Sadly there's too much soundtrack used throughout the film and it has the effect of making the movie feel thirty-year old.",negative
"The movie wasn't great, a bit of overreaching of the actors (maybe over-directed?) but the context was great. The Nigerian dance and music and the issues of our protagonists round out the whole movie",negative
Only in broad Nollywood comedy mode does it feel truly convincing.,negative
"Slow moving, great acting and contains a few chills but the ending was unforgiving",negative
"It's spooky and atmosperic with a slow-creeping dread that doesn't really pay off in the end.

",negative
"Good until the end

This movie made sense up until the non-ending; full of bad advice.

Not sure at all what that was. Would love to give it more than 4 but I was truly too disappointment and bewildered to give it anything more.

Horrible mistake!",negative
"This medical drama was alright. Danny Glover and the rest of the cast did a decent job in this movie. This movie based on the ebola outbreak in Nigeria was very depressing and it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. In fact, it wasn't what I was expecting either. I thought that this was going to be about doctors fighting for a cure for their patients, but instead it was the doctors and nurses fighting for their lives. That's what I didn't like about this movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie. It's not worth it.",negative
"Well intentioned but amateurish attempt to move the viewer, while failing to recognize that the subject matter (a man's conversion from slaver to emancipator) itself is plenty dramatic -- just tell the story, straight, no chaser! The acting is wooden, the camera set-ups are uninspired and TV-like, and the costume and set design fairly shout ""Student film!"" Everything is too clean, the native women wear modest tops in an ecuatorial climate, and everyone looks like they just stepped out of the make-up trailer in Burbank. And the notion that the song ""Amazing Grace"" itself is a cribbing of an African melody is a flat falsehood. The instantly recognizable melody is from the 1835 song, ""New Britain,"" though the lyrics predated it by over 50 years. The way the filmmakers attempt to connect the melody to African folk music is cynical and manipulative. A great story always moves the audience. Newton's real story is far more compelling than the one told in this film. It has all the required elements of a great motion picture, but the filmmakers -- obviously spiritual amateurs themselves -- did not understand or trust the Spirit when they made this film. If they were sincere, five stars for trying. If not, zero. But the film itself? Two stars for a botched effort with no excuse available in the source material.",negative

Could have been a great movie but muddles along with many scenes rushed as it cuts back and forth between the historical backdrop and the love melodramas,negative
"This movie is a complete mess. The source material is amazing, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's book of the same name, an Orange Prize for Fiction winner among other awards. The adaptation simply did not translate well, the pace is terrible, the editing is sloppy, resulting in a overly melodramatic and contrived movie that probably could have worked as a Tv mini-series",negative
almost felt like 2 different movies. The story needed tighter translation of the events happening. Thandie & Chiwetel are great as always.,negative
"The sketchy storyline is overly reliant on clich, caricature and contrivance.",negative

There are some funny touches and moments of freewheeling energy, but it is too broad, with acting and directing styles that are a little like afternoon TV.",negative
"
An occasionally engaging but often hamfisted urban fable.",negative
As a comedy it starts out well enough but soon gets a little (but not much) more drama-like with its storyline to the detriment of the film. Has a very inner-city urban styling.,negative
"Boring movie but kind of educative

I found this movie very boring but kind of educative.",negative
kinda boring and inconsistent. a lot of confusing narratives choices,negative
"I really wanted to like this film. I liked most of the actors and the production quality was good, but even though it was only 1 hr 34 it seemed to drag on forever. I had to stop and start this movie a few times. I finally finished it after a couple of months.",negative
"Looking at Nollywood so far, Lionheart is really a step ahead. The director also taking the lead role might look somehow, but I wasn't dissapointed at the end of the movie. Although the tension is not too high, suspense is not a thing, the obstacle could have taken more sweat and sacrifices, but yet, Lionheart is really good.",negative
"The movie seemed generally flat and draggy though out. The boardroom scenes were amateur & unrealistic. I almost stopped watching, until Godswill (Nkem Owoh) appeared. Even then, it appeared the film didn't bring the best out of him, or even the rest of the cast. I'm giving 2 stars because of the production quality which is beginning to improve generally with Nigerian films, the collaboration between 2 major ethnic groups, and the attempt to dispel the myth that all members of a particular ethnic group are dodgy. Oh, and the scene at the beginning also turned out to be pointless, besides showing that the super star Genevieve can stop men from fighting.

"Whereas, when a Yoruba movie is coming to cinema, one would expect sense & sophistication; something fresh, something unique, something remarkable. Not so here. 'Ajibade' is a typical Yoruba film with no real talent behind it",negative
Serious performances are non existent in 'African Messiah'. Dialogue is a total wash. Production is laughable. And exorbitant over acting is par for the course. Kindergarten stuff.,negative

"Regardless of how flagrantly it copycats off '√ìm√≥ Ghetto: The Saga' desperately hoping to shine like it. Unlike that one which had no ghosts to boast of, 'Ghost and The Tout Too' doesn't understand that movie-making is rooted in brain-work and not in using cinema to do ""Yahoo"", abusing stardoms to fleece fandoms. Sadly.

In 'The Ghost and The Tout Too', celebrity after celebrity lead only to leprotic performance after leprotic performance. As a haplessly brain-dead story leads to pointless scene after pointless scene, all soaked in a deluge of sterile dialogue. So much so that trying to find any mirth seeing it would be an exercise in futility.",negative
"Joseph' is like a cheap telenovela made of the most boring stuff. A totally sub-brilliant offering, it tells a piecemeal story one could swear was hurriedly written by a primary school pupil for last year's Cultural Day drama presentation. And as though stealing the poor child's story wasn't low enough, ""the parents"" responsible for smuggling it into the cinema didn't care much for dotting the i's, crossing the t's and generally giving poor 'Joseph' an appearance of being well thought out. A complete waste of time and money. Jump am pass!",negative
"Fix Us' is a brazenly useless movie. You pay for it: You pay for pain. Its highlights include; bad acting, shabby story-telling, horrendous make-up and an idiotic story that feels more like badly told gist than a written down story.

Admittedly, there are a few entertaining sequences sprinkled here and there (all available thanks going to Mr Bakare in particular and Mr Duncan too with the remainder). Unfortunately, all those ""here and there"" reside in the middle of a thick moat of stinking crap that will make you shake with anger. And then? There's ""Part 2""! Gaddamit!",negative
"Oh! Wait. That's true: 'Kpali' has nothing. A profoundly useless movie, 'Kpali' is an empty box, literally. A ludicrous and baseless story that needed no telling, a flurry of mechanical robotic like acting performances, a terrible lack of chemistry and very obviously forced comedy are the Ninjas you will have to contend with if you near this mishap.",negative
"A confirmed snooze fest, 'Kpali' is lifeless. Forceful story-telling and embarrassingly bad acting are the hallmarks of this shabby pretender - Might sound weird but; this flick is like a counterfeit of 'Isoken'. Unfortunately for it, it lacks the candour and the fluidity of that masterpiece. What 'Kpali' has is ......?",negative
"Seeing 'The Ghost And The House of Truth' is like eating very well cooked white rice. Problem is; There's no soup. There's no stew. There's no meat. Not even fish head on top. Fantastic production. Solid acting. Lazy story. Equals = No Magic. No sizzles. An empty suit. The result: A dulled out audience, sleeping and snoring.",negative
"While the producers of 'The Herbert Macaulay Affair' must get an ""A"" for effort, especially in terms of setting, costumes and props, they earned themselves a Mighty Big ""F"" for failing to create the Magic, the flutter and the spark great movies create in the hearts and minds of their audience.

Instead, the producers serve us a cold turkey. No sauce. No salt. Crippled by mechanical transitions, robotic acting, terrible lack of chemistry and flimsy story telling, 'The Herbert Macaulay Affair' looks good but is very hard to eat. Worst part is; the desperately annoying music that plays continuously throughout, making dialogue hard-to-hear and in many cases downright inaudible.",negative
"Not recommended. Some movies are made to win awards and thrill their producers. Some movies are made to excite and please their audience. If you know that you are not in the business of ""awarding"" awards to movies, you have absolutely no business 'Farming'. Attempt to do so, and you will harvest loads of pain and regret. This movie is excruciatingly boring!

The acting is great. No doubt. The production is pristine. No doubt. But all that aside; 'Farming' is a total and complete waste of money. Forget the hype. This is just another dark British movie that makes for a solemn and laborious watch. It was not made for Nigerians. Run!",negative
"Alubarika' isn't terrible as far as acting and production goes; at two and a half hours long, it makes for a frustrating cinema experience - especially if you are not a sucker for Yoruba movies by nature. And even if you are a sucker for Yoruba movies (nothing wrong with being one), you have to know that 'Alubarika' is just another run of the mill Yoruba mov",negative
"The Good' is so bad, they named it ""Good"". Ensuring that: No matter what! There must be something good about 'The Good' movie. After all, nobody can say ""Good is Bad"", they must have thought. But just as Nigeria discovered recently that; even Goodluck can be bad luck, we found out this afternoon that 'The Good' is bad. Very bad.",negative
"Maybe the best thing about this is that it's at least entertaining enough that you won't tear your hair out if you happen to see it. However, you will know very quickly that you've paid way more than it's worth. Because by rights, 'Father of Today' ought to be available for free on YouTube. Not showing in cinema.",negative
"Once Upon A Night' is a dud. The audience didn't like it. And neither did we. Some would try excusing it, claiming it is too complicated and too masterfully storied for the ""ordinary"" viewer- Mere propaganda. Bottom line: As a movie, 'Once Upon A Night' is dastardly boring. And as horror it fails woefully.",negative
"Unfortunately, we can't bear cowboy pistols, space guns, cut & sow costumes, annoyingly talentless filming and unnecessary long form remembrance ceremonies for already shown footage all buttered up with ridiculously unintelligent revelations of supposed-to-be shockers that were apparent from the beginning.

If Africa Magic Channel 157 is not your addiction, we strongly, strongly, strongly suggest you work very hard to avoid this. 'Gbarada' wasn't made for you, as it wasn't for us. Damn! This home-video hurt.",negative
"If somehow, you can imagine sitting through a Nollywood attempt at a live-action re-imagination of some of Disney's greatest animated musicals; that nightmare you will see is what we suffered painfully through today seeing 'The Ten Virgins'. Terribly revolting, 'The Ten Virgins' is guaranteed to make your skin crawl and your tummy turn.  If you know anyone deserving of your punishment, just buy them a ticket.",negative
"There's too little value here to be worth paying premium for. 'Thank God I Am Funny' comes in two parts. The first part runs for approximately ten minutes. In it, you get to watch Falz and company attempting to help SLK with haphazard and lackluster performances in successive skits, with their faces screaming: ""I don't want to be here!"". Consequently, they aren't half as funny as they are in skits offered on their own Instagram pages.

Part two is a gory tale of misfiring. For approximately an hour and twenty minutes, SLK will fight desperately to make you laugh, in a stand up session that feels like something in-between putting up with a talkative you don't like and listening to a friend trying to uplift your mood in a moment of sadness. Sandwiched by a desert of dead sticks, too few of the jokes offered are genuinely funny.

The producers brazenly attempt to cover-up these failures by heavily buffering the ""movie"" with elongated clips of an animated audience watching the live show. In reaction to the over dramatization, you will often find your nose sending out ""yinmu"" emojis involuntarily. Because, for all that this is, the incoming N200 DVD is your safest option. If you risk paying more; you won't leave happy.",negative
"¬†If we say 'Rant Queens' is stupid, we wouldn't be telling you the whole story. 'Rant Queens' is reckless with stupidity. It is yet another sad example of Iweka road and Ebinpejo lane ""stylishly"" invading cinemas with health hazards like 'Rant Queens', hellbent on bringing Nollywood into final disrepute and ghastly opprobrium. If you enjoy self mutilation, you may go ahead and see it. But we strongly, strongly, strongly suggest you avoid this pile of rubbish: Production. Rubbish! Acting. Rubbish! Story. Twice as useless!",negative
"Just as the saying goes: ""All that glitters is not Gold"", 'The Bling Lagosians' is not Gold. We strongly recommend waiting for it to cool down at the cinemas. However, if you choose to rush it at its current ""Blockbuster"" rate of Two Thousand, Five Hundred Naira; we further recommend you don't accompany it with beverage. Buy water instead. It will help with your hissing as you are served copied scenario after copied scenario, many shamelessly stolen from other recent Nollywood movies. Disappointing. Blah!!",negative
"Clustered Colours' is like cheap doughnut with plenty of nothing around a very tiny something. Unfortunately that ""tiny something"" is too tiny to be worth paying a premium to see. Maybe even too tiny to be regarded as a movie. At its heart, 'Clustered Colours' is essentially a very-short ""play"" speaking on challenges of marriage, importance of forgiveness and paramountcy of Love. Now, that is all good. The problem rises because that entire ""play"" is only twenty minutes long, yet 'Clustered Colours' runs a total of ninety minutes. What happened to the ""extra"" seventy minutes? Well...",negative
"Fifty minutes is spent advertising a holiday resort in Lagos, which stars as both ""the real"" subject matter of 'Clustered Colours' and the movie-location. The producers will call it ""character development"". We call it a kidnap- Held hostage for fifty odd minutes, we were forced on an excursion of the resort grounds, making stops at the tennis court, the football pitch, the gym and swimming pool area that have nothing to do with the movie. After which the short ""play"" occurs. Then we spend the last twenty minutes watching the actors dance to music by Tosin Martins and other artistes. That's it! Movie closes. Money down the drain. Not recommended.",negative
" A lot of work and ambition went into making 'Heaven's Hell'. But in the end, despite all the work. And all the ambition. 'Heaven's Hell' just isn't interesting. If you choose to see it, you will find there's more Hell waiting for you than Heaven. This movie itself is An Actor- The best thing it has going for it; is its ability to pretend. From its trailer to deep into its beginning, 'Heaven's Hell' proves extremely adept at pretending to be exciting or will be exciting. When in actual fact, it is numbing and drab. You will leave the cinema with a stinging feeling of: ""What did I just watch? One Five entered fire!""

We really wanted to like this. But it is plagued with so many problems, it is too stubborn to be likable. A pretender to the core, 'Heaven's Hell' is Un-Nigerian and Fake. It wants so much to be like the 'Tinsel' series but in actual fact it is a classless thug. The words ""F*ck"" and ""F*cking"" being its undoing, 'Heaven's Hell' could well be described as Tinsel's bastard half-brother. Blindly desperate for attention and notoriety, it unnecessarily uses ""F*ck"" and ""F*cking"" more than forty different times. Everything here is ""F this"" and ""F that"". When they are fighting; it is F! F! F! And even when they are loving; it is still F! F! F! One begins to wonder if the script was written by Tupac. Beyond that is an absolute lack of chemistry between actors. All good actors, with individually good performances. As a collective however, they don't gel at all. One actor's delivery to the next feels so mechanical, reminding us of that famed party game: ""Musical Statues"". And it doesn't help that the entire movie is subtitled in English, even though actors are speaking English. And these subtitles are tattered; drowned in errors and shredded by typos. To add insult to injury; like a pirated-Chinese copy, many times the subtitles don't sync with actual dialogue. There are myriad of issues with 'Heaven's Hell', but we will stop our recount here so we may yet sleep in peace.

Note to Nollywood: Subtitles in cinema kill suspense. Especially when not done correctly. In 'Heaven's Hell' as it was in 2018's 'Esohe', several lines of dialogue appear on screen before being spoken. Consequently, the pause effect of their delivery on the audience is lost as we can already see, four or five words forward, what actors are going to say next. Without surprise, dialogue is impotent.",negative
"Night Bus to Lagos' is ""One-Chance"" waiting to happen. Despite being produced by Zeb Ejiro and directed by Chico Ejiro, two Nollywood Goliaths, this 'Night Bus to Lagos' fails to arrive safely. Taking a ride on this derelict contortion characterized by old school film-making techniques, was a terribly discomforting experience for us. Making it seem like; their glory days behind them, ""our fathers"" failed to spend the passing years learning and improving. Consequently, their swords have since grown dull. And their talents, decrepit. Hence, this wreck of a movie plays like a relic straight out of the nineties. A complete waste of money.",negative
"Despite its comical poverty however, we wouldn't be telling you the whole story if we failed to mention that it did have a few shining moments where it succeeded in drawing out some bouts of spirited laughter from quite a number of people in the audience. But unfortunately, these shining moments were just to few and far between for them to justify paying serious money to see this. We strongly suggest waiting till 'Makate Must Sell' takes up residence at your neighborhood video rental store where it rightly belongs.",negative
"Plagued by everything from terrible story telling to shoddy production to generally very-below average acting, 'Alter Date' is yet another home video that should have been released out of Idumota. And like all that wasn't bad enough, this home video has no ending.",negative
"The story is so convoluted and so unnecessarily dragged out that, even after running for a whole ""one hour and fifty minutes"" these fellows still had to use epilogues to explain what happened to the characters.

"This movie is ugly. ""Ugly"" must be the word. '1929' is an eyesore. Featuring some of the worst and shabbiest costumes, props and appurtenances to ever come out of Nollywood, '1929' is utterly and extremely displeasing to look at. Goodness gracious! 'Igodo: The Land of the Living Dead' all the way back from 1999 featured way, way better costumes and props. As a matter of fact, even the old school re-enactments of 'Tales by Moonlight' from 1984 were light years better.

Purporting to tell historical heroic stories of sacrifice and resolve against oppressive colonialism, '1929' is so terrible at it that; in all honesty it stands out only as a great disservice to our fallen heroes. We are sure that, if these valiant ancestors could speak to us today,our fallen heroes. We are sure that, if these valiant ancestors could speak to us today, on account of '1929' they would vehemently insist; their stories be left in books. Even now, we continue to sympathize with all the school children who may be forced to see this as part of their History Studies. Please, don't waste your money on this atrociously filthy crap. If you do, you will live to regret it.",negative
"Guynman' is special. It is specially stupid. And you know, we have seen many stupid movies in our time. You know this. You know. But 'Guynman' is different.

Zero Hour' is most definitely bound to be a Zero for you if you grew up on a respectable diet of Hollywood movies.

Infuriating balderdash, seeing 'The Culprit' is a truly torturous experience. This one is not ""home video"". It is just video. Avoid it even if it is free.",negative
" 'Sista Sista' is yet another colossal waste of money starring Enyimma Nwigwe, making it two crappy movies he has headlined in one weekend. Such a shame that he will allow his brand be used to deceive and cajole his fans into splurging on offerings he ought to have known will most definitely turn out to be end-time disasters.

"The Call' is awesomely retarded. But that's not how it earned that ""Not recommended"". It is not recommended because; despite what is admittedly very crispy production, ultimately 'The Call' plays like just another run-of-the-mill Yoruba-Nolly comedy: You know those legacy Yoruba comic flicks that are typically packed with characters obviously acting retarded through a series of nonsensical scenarios, ensuring they will annoy more than amuse anyone looking for sophisticated and subliminal comedy.",negative
"A colossal waste of time and money, 'Knock Out Blessing' is an utterly useless movie that ought not to have been made, or at least not released to the public. So boring and lifeless, it was a real struggle staying awake whilst seeing it. Probably, the only good thing here was watching Demola Adedoyin perfectly play a one eyed assassin. Asides that, the trailer of 'Knock Out Blessing' is a million times more interesting than 'Knock Out Blessing'. You will do well to avoid this, for life. Rubbish!",negative
" At approximately two hours long, the far majority of 'God Calling' is unexciting, bland and dreary. We are talking a solid one hour and maybe some twenty or thirty minutes of dryness, dullness and soullessness. Try as hard as it may, 'God Calling' failed to connect for an entire One Hour and Twenty Minutes! The hall was a graveyard with silence and dis-interest holding sway. Though it finally catches steam some twenty minutes to its close, with failure like that, we can't recommend 'God Calling' for cinema. ",negative

Verdict: Not recommended. 'Charmed' is not charming. While there's a lot of passion behind it, there's just too little quality to make this a worthy offering. It is amateurish, in every way.

"Psychological Horror, Nollywood Style!!!
meddlecore14 October 2017
A young couple- expecting a new baby- move into a new house, which they acquire for a crazy good deal.

But things might be too good to be true.

Because, as soon as they move in, the man's girlfriend starts seeing things. Things moving, things turning on or opening by themselves...and also a cloaked and hooded demon of some sort.

But nobody else sees it, so they all think she is going crazy from the pregnancy...or has become bewitched.

Eventually, she loses the baby to a miscarriage...but she truly believes that it was stolen by the demon.

Now, he's upset with his wife...and starts to push her away. Until...he starts to see the same demon...

Now he thinks he's going crazy, because of the loss of the baby.

He refuses to believe there is anything wrong with the house, despite his wife being adamant, that is where the problem lies.

But, after he mistakes his wife for the demon and beats her up, his friend convinces him to hire a spiritualist. If only to figure out what is going on.

Turns out, when he bought the house, there was a grave inside. He and his friend dug up the body and moved it, because he feared his wife would not accept living in a house with a dead body.

Now, he must return the man to his grave and leave the house...or he will perish...

But he can't, because they disposed of his bones in a way that they can' be retrieved. So, they use a psychic to settle a deal with the angry spirit...to return the house to his family's heirs...so that they can be forgiven.

The rest of this 2 hour film (it's not short!), is the guy sleuthing his way to find out whose house it originally was...and it culminates with a weird nuclear family situation...and the mentioning of a war I had to google (though I had actually heard of it, just not by that name).

Honestly, this film is bad, but in a great way. I enjoyed the sh*t out of this. It had me laughing- at the bad jokes, the cheesy scare gags, the mediocre acting, and over the fact that the lead actor is the Nollywood version of Cuba Gooding Jr.

And just think about it...this is 1 of 105 films Ikechukwu Onyeka has made in 12 years.

That's insane turnout.

And this entertained me for 2 hours...so good f*cking on him! ",negative

"""They deported me from the USA""

Some things are universal, wherever you go you will find a film student producing a self-righteous movie about how difficult it is to produce movies, and Green White Green is the most typical example of this archetype.

The film features all of the hallmarks of a poorly produced student film: royalty-free music, unprofessional and generally very bad actors, some inspired visuals but generally poorly composed cinematography, dreadful editing, and a clear lack of confidence in their own creative vision that the film's narrative must be meta and ironic in some sense. If I wanted to see this calibre of filmmaking I would have attended the screening of films from production students at my own university, which I did not. The only distinction between this and the films that my peers produce is the slight novelty of this being a Nigerian production however that largely feels like a wasted opportunity. Themes of class and wealth are certainly discussed but are massively overlooked. For all the empty platitudes the film preaches about wealth inequality there are clear instances wherein the film exhibits its own prejudices towards impoverished people, be it the unfavourable light the rival group of lads are shown in because of their background, blatant xenophobia towards people of the impoverished nations (particularly other African nations and the middle east) and generally holding the West (particularly Northern Europe and the United States) to high regard. This is unsurprising from a director who was taught filmmaking at NYU (New York University). In interviews director Abba Makama speaks at length about how the film represents the different ethnic groups of Nigeria and puts homegrown, indigenous African artistry on a pedestal, when the film itself has such an overt occidental vision and hardly ever properly explores themes of race and poverty. As virtuous and important as he believes his film to be, Green White Green is just a dime a dozen not only in terms of its typical film student approach but also it being lost in a sea of Nollywood movies, a vast number of which more adequately explore themes of race and Nigerian nationality. Remove those themes and this is just as generic a movie that anyone with a couple years of formal education could produce.

And it comes with the territory of a student film that there might be some inspired elements. A clear admiration for the canon of film that came before it, some ambitious cinematography, a fairly decent script, again these things are not uncommon of a student film but aid in making Green White Green at least engaging to a certain extent.",negative
"In the Figurine 2 friends are into the same girl. One is kind of a jerk and the other is a nerdy nice guy. Guess which one gets the girl... The nerdy guy finds a relic that gives him good luck and changes him from Steve Urkel to Stephan Urkel. I guess in this tale after the 7 years of good luck is up, you get 7 years bad luck. 

I was kind of digging it at first but the movie has pacing issues, needs to be edited, and is way too long. There was a part where I thought it was almost over only to realize there was 40 more minutes. That's about 30 mins too long for this. Kind of disappointing.",negative

""Are you telling me that you're on an Okada wearing a 1,000 Naira dress? Are you mad?""

What a great introduction to Nollywood. This is a campy drama/romance/comedy about a man and woman who get their phones swapped, and now need to swap them back. They go on a crazy adventure and fall in love in the process. With a few different cultural references, this film could have been made in any other country. While it's a fairly tired plot, it's made with a such an earnestness and sincerity that is charming.

I think Wale Ojo and Nse Ikpe Etim are incredibly watchable actors. I like them both a lot. Everyone in the film is enjoyable in one way or another, even if most of the people in this film aren't professional actors (or at least have limited experience with film acting). The production value is a little sloppy, but director Kunle Afolayan clearly has a grip on what he's doing and is influenced by western cinema. The jokes and the way the story hits so many different tones lack polish, and I'd struggle to say it's a 'good' or 'artistic' film, but it's very easy to watch.

"W h a t

Messed up and kind of all over the place plot, wants to be empowering but I'm not completely sure it succeedes and I'm not completely sure what the message of the film is.. what was the point of all that? Did they truly find their freedom? It's not even clear if Charity even ever wanted it or if she was just playing along in the game... 
BUT
this film completely catches you by surprise in the most unexpected way as it turns into a sort of musical: the music is vibrant and colorful but it's weird cause it seems like it's not even music, they're not even singing? Are they rapping? At times it's like they're just talking and there's music but there isn't? Anyway it's crazy and I loved it but I don't think I loved the rest

Also fucking hate the title",negative
"Good looking Nollywood capitalist exploitation thriller which has a very one dimensional script and a wildly variable cast quality. Action sequences weren't bad and its heart was in the right place, but quite painful to watch in places.",negative

Genevieve is married to a selfish prick who is musty on top of it while she is gorgeous, amazing and pretty sure she smells good as well.

Credited for catalyzing direct-to-video distribution format in Nigerian cinema. This reportedly had a cross-cultural success so unheard of before that, local markets were later flooded with numerous releases borrowing money ritual theme introduced here. In what looks like a fairly well, right on trend assembled production for its time. Rapu taps into discontent in everyman to gradually elevate the storyline ‚Äî into a morale bound supernatural drama.

Regrettably, there's a large disparity between what it is doing & what the one it is evident like. Even larger disparity exists for those who watch today to come closer anywhere near the shooked excitement Nigerians probably felt ‚Äî watching both the parts on VHS in 90s. A runtime of beyond-five hours is far too stretch in making protagonist pay for his committed sins, to be all of a sudden released on a religious gaslighting note.

"So this is a disjointed mess of a movie, and given that one of the main actors is also the writer and producer and that pretty much every supporting character is falling over themselves to tell the protagonists how immensely nifty they are, I'd guess that this is, in fact, a rather crappy vanity project.",negative
"I  guess it was not a comedy?!

The way the shots are made was like it is a comedy movie.

Some dialogues sound like it was a comedy.

But it is not funny in any way.

The movie was well done but I could not figure out what type of movie it wanted to be and what was the story about until I stopped watching somewhere at the middle.",negative

"During its theatrical run, Omo Ghetto: The Saga became the highest grossing Nollywood movie of all time. Of course, making plenty money doesn't automatically equate to being a good film, but for some idealic reason of wanting perfection or some semblance of it, I held onto a notion that Omo Ghetto: The Saga wouldn't be a bad, bad movie. I was wrong. I wonder how many more times I'd be wrong before I finally fully understand the writing on the wall - the chances of Nollywood making a great film is pretty slim.

'Omo Ghetto: The Saga' has obvious good intentions and a decent story it plays close to its heart, but it's held back by some of the same vices that has bedevilled many other hyped Nollywood flicks in recent memory, most notably its weak screenplay with dialogues that leave so much to be desired. It is also undeservedly long, and has a plethora of pointless and unlikeable supporting characters that take up a large of the screentime without an iota of development, among many other issues.

Mostly set in the slums, the movie (actually a sequel to its 2010 predecessor, for those who don't know) spotlights Lefty, a character incredibly brought to life by Funke Akindele, and her dual life as a child of Askamaya, the titular ghetto, and also that of a wealthy home. Balancing these two different realities takes a toll on her and on the people around her. In many parts, the movie pays homage to the colourful, complex lives of gangsters it draws a clear inspiration from, but, it's its inability to actually weave all the interesting moving parts into one captivating piece that ends up being its greatest undoing. At best, Omo Ghetto: The Saga is a sour, overstretched moral instruction video disguised as a feel-good movie, and at worst, watching it is a complete waste of time and resources that could've been better spent on something more productive.

Once again, this is a good opportunity to reiterate that Nollywood really needs to start doing better with its stories if it wants to be taken more seriously in the global scene. Imagine someone in the abroad asked for our highest grossing movie list and this shows up? We've cracked the intricasies of picture quality, can we stop exchanging this testimonial for a decent screenplay, please?",negative

"Well, there's the bad guy who may be a good guy, and Abigail Spencer who was great in 'Rectify', an interchangeable white guy, and a black guy going through time trying to stop the bad guy. Abigail isn't very good, the bad guy is a bit of a moustache twister, and they figured out that it sucks for black people to go back in time",negative
"On the eve of Sanitation Day (in which everybody is confined indoors while everything is cleaned) police inspectors Hassan (the Denzel-like cool and collected one) and Stanley (the young hothead) try to solve a possible murder in a tenement building while dealing with uncooperative tenants, shoddy alibis, language barriers and the time they have left before the scene is scrubbed clean. 

Shortlisted for Nigeria‚Äôs entry to the 2021 Oscars, this certainly is a movie. In as much as it was filmed, has performances, and something resembling a plot. I‚Äôm not familiar with any of the cast or creative, but some of them are pretty big names in Nollywood, and apparently have done a lot better than this. 

Me, I‚Äôve seen worse, but it‚Äôs not memorable in any way (except for Beanie Guy). Not bad, not good, just unmemorable. Is there a twist in the tale? Of course there is. Is it good? Eh, I guess. ",negative
"A shame that a film with such a fascinating backstory (character from a popular beer commercial campaign gets an action movie sponsored by a UN agency, set in an unnamed African country stitched together from scenes filmed across five countries) ends up being so lacklustre.

"Well, when the main positive thing that people list about the film is the colour grading, you probably know you‚Äôre not going to experience an amazing story. And for a supernatural horror thriller revenge movie that features serpentine possession‚Ä¶ it ironically lacks a lot of bite.

Idia Aisien proves being beautiful and having a slamming figure isn‚Äôt enough to be seductive. It requires a force of personality and her performance just seems a bit flat for me. Once the revenge murder spree kicks in there‚Äôs no real suspense or atmosphere conjured. Everything just seems very staid. And when a film isn‚Äôt very involving, a 140 minute runtime is most unwelcome.

But it‚Äôs not without merit, there‚Äôs a decent score and some very pretty cinematography here. Oh and I have I mentioned the colour grading? Really is the best thing about this film. I‚Äôve never seen the original but I can see why its fans aren‚Äôt happy with the remake. It‚Äôs beautifully bland.",negative

"Rubbish! Not recommended for anybody. Not even children. Very irritating movie, 'Another Father's Day' will leave you with a migraine. With terrible acting and an outstandingly imbecilic story-line, this ridiculous low grade Disney wannabe excuse of a comedy will make anyone and everyone lose interest in Nollywood forever. Such a sham. And a terrible waste, this is what comes of writing stories and producing movies with the sole intention of advertising an amusement park, but people shouldn't have to pay to watch long-form adverts. We strongly suggest you stay far away from this filth if you value your time and energy.",negative
"Zena' isn't a terrible movie. A lot of effort went into making it good. One can easily see great effort in the costuming and propping- While they aren't particularly spectacular, their above-average quality advertises the amount of time, energy and money expended seeking excellence for 'Zena'. The acting was also quite good. The Problem with 'Zena' is that it is boring as hell. The story it tells is too basic to be remembered. Ultimately, 'Zena' proved too unappealing to stir any excitement in its audience. Put you to sleep, it will.",negative
"Purporting to tell historical heroic stories of sacrifice and resolve against oppressive colonialism, '1929' is so terrible at it that; in all honesty it stands out only as a great disservice to our fallen heroes. We are sure that, if these valiant ancestors could speak to us today, on account of '1929' they would vehemently insist; their stories be left in books.

"The Final List' is a concoction of relentless hogwash. It will drive you to the very edge of insanity, with its amateurish story-telling, terrible acting and production values straight out of the late 1980s.

If you desire to keep your sanity, stay far away from this pile of smoking rubbish, lest it be your final movie.",negative
"Funke' tells a very basic story that could have been powerful and relevant had it been told two decades ago. Its lateness aside, the real problem with 'Funke' is that it is boring and unexciting.

"Nollywood does the evil-kid-run-amok movie, replacing creepiness, tension and terror with broad comedy, needlessly over-long scenes and general irritation.
Dada is the diabolical kid in question. After sabotaging a local workman's equipment for dangerous laughs, the locals force him out of his own village and he is reluctantly sent to live with an uncle in the city.
Once in the big city and left to his devices (why?!), Dada impersonates a Profit in order to acquire an old TV and persuade a woman to undress. When that scam is eventually exposed, Dada gives all of his uncle's savings to a couple of conmen.
'You are killing me Dada!' & then... 'You have killed me Dada! quickly become the mantra of the exasperated uncle.
Finally Dada forms his own police force (made up of local grown men!) and harasses innocent motorists at checkpoints in the neighbourhood...
With its ever-present nauseating score soundtracking almost the whole film regardless of what is happening and Dada's initially amusing, but quickly grating mugging for the camera, Baby Police becomes a film to tolerate rather than enjoy.",negative
"The plot is unbelievably bad, and the actors obviously do not comport themselves in a way that suggests they believe in the script.

"The movie had no subplots that we could follow. Also, One thing that could have provided some authenticity was to see RMD in an actual winery to provide backing for his 200 Million Naira loan for the business.
