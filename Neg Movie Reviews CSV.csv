"This film is well intended and tries to go in depth on the issue, but sadly the filmmaking is so incompetent that it takes any emotional impact away.",0.5
"Absolute Garbage
Not even worth being filmed. Actors are weak, script was written by a 12 year old. Poor sound quality.",1
"Depressingly Boring and Pointless

There was a time Nigerian movies did engage you. Now its getting worse. Its like someone just comes up with a different story and tries to force it on everyone by using top actors. At the end, the movie fails in every way. The director needs a reorientation.",1
"Trash.

Pointless movie with mostly terrible acting and very shallow characters. It doesn't help either that it was basically full of tribalist jabs at Igbo from Yoruba people.",1
"Awful

The most stupid and dumb storyline in Nigerian movies history. Please don't waste your time.",1

"MESSED UP MOVIE
No lesson learnt. Too many star actors. Highly disappointed in all of them. The big actors all of a sudden sound foolish in one movie. Those that are not comedians decided to try out with this movie. Unserious roles. Please we don't want part2. Its enough here",1
"Poor acting with shallow characters

I really couldn't wait to watch this movie only to get disappointed! The whole thing felt forced and rushed. Porous acting with shallow characters. I was cringing throughout because it was simply not funny.",1
"When is going to end?

To summarize the plot, it was leaking like a sieve.

The characters somehow became a lot more annoying and unrealistic, plus no tangible development. Was it funny? Maybe it could be if you don't spend the near 2hrs watching the movie wanting to punch the director/screenwriter.

Why do these caliber of films make it past the home video format and into the big screens (platform wise) in big 2022? The world is watching, and these people are doing Nollywood's reputation no good... look at Nigeria's music industry for a change!",1
"A WASTE OF TIME

Wow... Chief daddy 2 is way worse than chief daddy 1, and I would rate chief daddy 1, a good 0.5/5.

This movie is bad... Very bad

Story line is incoherent, plot was non existent, actors were below par.

I am shocked that this came from Ebonylife studios. A star studded cast did nothing for the movie... Except make it obvious that the director Niyi Akinmolayan has no idea what he was doing.

I am also shocked that Mo Abudu is the writer.

This movie is worse than appalling

It was a waste if 1hr and 50 mins.

This is the first disaster of 2022.

If I would beg for one thing...

DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!

Rating: E better to fast than chop nonsense (-5/5) 😠😠😠😠",1
"Chief Daddy 2: A Movie To Avoid
I dragged myself to see Chief Daddy 2 and I must confess that's the worst way to start a new year. The movie is a total waste of time and if you're yet to see it, PLEASE DON'T. The industry needs to tender an apology to the viewers.",1
"Absolutely horrendous
Storyline is absolutely the worst, could not bring myself to watch till the end. Just packed many stars. How can I be 1hr into a comedy drama without laughing? Disappointed.",1
Chief Daddy 2 Disastrously Fails to Deliver Quality,1
"DONT
It's really awful. I feel embarrassed for all the actors/actresses. I watched it cos I was curious about the bad reviews. But wow. I'm not watching any Ebonylife movie going forward. Clearly, someone doesn't have their head screwed on in there.",1
"What a waste of time

Mediocre at best. A mix of too many famous (famous not meaning good) actors and a script that has so many holes it might as well be a sieve. Need 2 hours worth of proof that Nollywood is mostly just transactional at the cost of actual art? Watch this.",1
"First disaster recorded in 2022

A painstaking experience is the movie suggests that the entire cast and crew aim was to achieve the first disaster in 2022. A Netflix release date of 1st of January 2022 further suggests that was the sole intention. The acting was bad, the soundtrack were repetitive, the storyline was... (if there was one I would have described it here). The worst part, there could be a Chief Daddy 3.",1
"Rubbish

One more piece of garbage from NETFLIX. Period !!

I am saying what it is .. Nothing more.",1
Boring and weak plot.,1
"What the hell is going on here
The movie is so bad at some point you wonder whether you're watching a comedy or a drama movie. It has zero essence, zero script, and zero interest. I guess all the 10/10 comments are paid but I did watch this on Netflix and I leave this review in case someone decides to skip the movie and get some more life time.",1
"Waste of time

I've never written a review for IMDb. I use it all the time to gauge movies and seeing the above reviews touting this film to be the best movie ever?? Huh?? Makes me seriously question the validity of ALLIMDb scores!! I kept waiting for something to happen in this moviè. Something to interest me or hook me...nothing what a Snoozefest!!",1
"Does not live up to Production Value

This movie was a movie that had great potential. A directorial debut of the Famous Nigerian Genevieve, packed with star studded Nigerian Names from Phyno, to Pete edochie. It also Had really fantastic production value, however that's as far as positives go.

One thing that a good movie needs above all else is ""story"". the story usually sets actors up for fantastic pe formances, can usually be the thing to sell a movie. However, this failed to be anything other than boring. It had no logical flow. It was trying to do a lot of things, like develop a love interest for Genevieve, set her up as a hardworking female, however it offers nothing in terms of bringing that to life. There should have been more connections to the characters, like what does Lionheart mean ?? Who exactly are these characters. It feels very empty and quickly put together.

Building on from that, another thing that makes movie so terrible is, because the story is terrible the actors cannot live up to their potential. They're stuck in a bad story, so there's nothing to immerse themselves in.

The film also has terrible writing which also contributes to the actor's terrible performances. I don't know who wrote this but it was really off the mark for writing. Some of the dialogue was so superficial and empty. They threw in some inspirational words here and there to try and do soemthing but it had no effect because they hadn't prepared for it properly. There was also a serious lack of research witht the writing. When you borrow 950 million naira,which is basically 2.6 million dollars, no company takes that kind of loan and pays back fully in a year. People pay interests on that loan, so that really messed up the story and writing. Also was the evil coworker a board member ?? What was he doing at those meetings ?? And how can a company which has a board be unaware of a 2.6 million dollar loan. It's jsust not possible, that's not how business works. It feels as if real life was bent to fit the terrible narrative this movie was trying to tell.

The only positive of this movie is production value. The cinematography is average holly wood standard, although it falters a lot. It's evident of a quite low budget Hollywood movie. It's netflix quality, let me put it that way in terms of original content. However, it still needs to improve. I think Genevieve needs to go on a masters in directing from a good film school to understand how to properly direct, it is really important she does that.

In conclusion, this was a movie that could have been groundbreaking in terms of Nigeria's first original Netflix content. However m perhaps shockingly, seeing as it was bought by Netflix, it was absolutely poor. And writing, bad story, bad acting. I can only congratulate the production value of this.",1
"Terrible Movie... worst Nigerian movie I've seen

Movie is so bad I had to create an account just to write this and let others know",1
"Very disappointing adaptation of great novel

Half of a Yellow Sun is a fantastic novel, so any adaptation was going to be very difficult. Adapting a great book should be approached with care and most successful adaptations have focused on one or two key events or characters rather than try to retell the whole story. In this case, the adaptation attempted to tell the whole story and, subsequently, manages to avoid any depth as it simply skims along the surface in order to get the end. Often, scenes which serve no point other than to relay a piece of background information continually appear and it is shocking that such experienced film makers failed to guide the writer/director away from such obvious pitfalls. In order to accommodate as many details as possible from the novel, many superfluous scenes lead only to confusion and rely on the audience either having read the novel or having in-depth knowledge of Nigeria's history. Some characters appear only to serve as expositional devices. This film has one or two excellent performances DESPITE the material but generally the actors appear to be at a loss as to what to do. This is the director's first movie and it could that he wasn't comfortable with the pressures of time and of shooting out of sequence. 

It is sad to be so 'down' on a movie that has its heart in the right place, and one can only imagine that Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie must rue the day that she allowed her beautiful work to be adapted by someone who had little or no grasp of the screen writing process that could have turned out a great film script.",1
"One of the worst

With the hype I would expect a great movie but this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. Great actors and good cast but the storyline and unnecessary scene create attention. I'm surprise some people actually find this movie fun because I couldn't really associate fun with this movie. The movie is quite boring , no anxiety and nothing to keep you on your feet or have you guessing . Really disappointed meanwhile I saw king of Johannesburg and I was wowed .. Now that's a movie.",1
"Major Disappointment

I was underwhelmed with this sequel. First she kept us on tenterhooks for years promising a movie, she then made a TV series and sold out to Netflix. I spent 7 hours watching this much hyped much anticipated sequel to take off, alas it didn't.",1
"REALLY STAINS NOLLYWOOD

This film is ridiculous with no plot motivation or character development. The end scene is unwatchable and awkward. These dancers can't dance to save their life. The main love story dies follow Nollywood troupes, but non of it usual substance. Hopefully the actors will recover from this.",1
"That movie is such a bad egg to Nollywood
That movie is wack, No story line, horrible dancing. Just a display of white man in Nollywood. Honestly, the white man acted well just happen to select the wrong movie to appear in.",1
"Do Not Watch!!!

Honestly this is the most useless movie ever I can't believe I watched something like this!!!!😡 Apart from nikita's horrible dancing , the movie didn't even have a real storyline to follow. And after all this amazing actors this is what they had to give??

If I mistakenly see anyone connected to this movie, I'll beat them.

They should be arrested abeg😭😭😭😭😭.",1
"Diabolically bad!

This is realistically the worst movie I've ever seen in my life!

The 'dancers' cannot dance to save their life and this film contains some of the most unattractive people I've ever seen assembled in one place, honestly seriously unattractive!

Now the plot, THERE ISN'T ONE!!!!

It's a garbled gab fest of white noise, gibberish for the sake of it!

Do NOT watch this movie under any circumstances, you've been warned !!!",1
"Too long, bad acting, too much irrelevance

The story it's based on is of course important, but the movie in generale is very disappointing. It's way too long, could have been caught down to 1,5 hour instead of 2,5 hours. Acting was terrible and dialogue was incredible stupid.",1
"Again and again BIAS BIAS

Citation movie in my own opinion is so unrealistic It's meant 4 a life touching incident student face on daily basis but acted with so little dramatic emotion I'm disappointed cos my hope where high d only thing they got right in D movie is just D costume & setup The casting is just so disappointing why must you be bias again to was casting give people who deserve this spot cmon And I respect the director but he has to do better the directing was awful None invoke the character they were meant to play not one But cmon we all know what was going to happen from the beginning of the movie No plot twist with some unrealistic scene (I still don't understand why the legal counsel was there when they did nothing in actual argument) And the movie mad Nigeria student stupid or not bein street wise cmon that disappointing",1
"Waste of time

If I could give it 0 stars I would for 2 reasons - #1 it's not filmed in Jamaica but is filmed in America and #2 super super super corny acting. I am Jamaican and am displeased that this movie even has the Jamaican flag on the cover. Very misleading.",1
"Not worth anyone's time
This movie is a disappointment and not worth anyone's time or money. It would have been an opportunity for Funke Akindele or/and the AY guy, to showcase their talent on world stage but they both failed at it. What a disastrous act and flopped comedy. If I could give less than 1 star, I would.",1
"Waste of time

Wasn't really a clear plot, didn't make sence and just having a Nigerian man cussing a Jamaican cuss word is not Jamaica?? Didn't enjoy it and just a stereotype of Jamaica?? Paul Campbell could have played so much better",1
This was bad in so many ways,1
"Awful and terrible film,

It's the worst film I've ever seen, the acting is so hammy, so crap and just awful, I wouldn't watch it again, I loved the clothes, the music, I've seen much better films than this.",1
"Propaganda and misuse

I have found it my obligation to talk about this topic as I have recently viewed this movie. The issues in todays modern age is racial profiling and racism which is a serious matter. I address this movie to be very misleading and further promotes discrimination by presenting African people uncivilised by having the typical stereotypes of African people in robes and acting like caveman thousands of years ago. It is a neccesity to remove this movie from being accessible to the media as it depicts and reinforces the great issues in today's modern society relating to racism.",1
"DO listen to the negative reviews

The people giving 10 stars to this movie must be getting some kind of royalties or something... , I thought this film would be something like lion but it wasn't, The movie is poorly executed, For me personally I found some of the actors if you can call them actors completely lacking in any acting skills whatsoever you might as well just got someone off the street Such very poor acting so amateur it's amazing they got away with it, when you've got acting that bad it takes away from the movie. Don't waste your time,",1
"Fake News Movie

Another reviewer on here stated they actually knew the author / subject of this movie growing up. You should listen to his review.

For a real review of the Tilbury Skins just use your favourite search engine and look up ""Tilbury Skins BBC Radio 1980"" and you will find a real news report on how 'The Sun' made up a story about how bad the skins were and staged photos and an interview.",1
"Horrible

The show lingers on and on seeming to go no where at times. Beckinsale does this in many of her movies. Underworld she didn't say much and was mostly just action which helps make the boredom factor better. It is no wonder she places such high emphasis on her looks to make up for her below par acting.",1
"Utter fiction
I put a message on here before and for some reason it's been taken down. I grew up in the same town and know the Director/Actor of this movie and it is a complete work of fiction. Apart from being a terrible film it isn't true. The acting is awful and the story unbelievable. I was discussing it with friends recently who went to school with ""Wally"", the name he was known by at school and they were laughing in disbelief. This might be based on a story but it is neither true or based on his life",1
"OMG Cringe

What the actual F. The dialogue, the acting, the soundtrack. How do titles like this make it into production?",1
"Good storyline, poor execution

An odd blend of great actors and amateurs. Couldn't even hear the dialogue because the audio editing was so poor. Unrealistic scenes, such as a mother visiting her dying child at the hospital dressed as if she was going to brunch with friends on the Upper East side. People grieve differently, but come on. Much missed details. I don't know how they got Isaiah Washington and a few others to participate. With attention to detail and coaching, this could have turned out to be a great movie.",1
"The Worst Music Scoring Ever!

Whoever did the music scoring for this movie did a horrible job. It must have been their first time scoring a movie. The music was very excessive...almost every scene which was very unnecessary. It overshadowed the dialogue in the scenes to the point where you cannot hear what the characters are saying. How did the director, producers, editors, etc. Thought it was acceptable for so intrusive music I do not know. Music in a film is supposed to add and enhance the telling of the story of a film and unfortunately the music took away and hindered the film. I could not enjoy due to that reason.",1
"Weak dialogue, amateurish battle scenes.

Seeing this movie was torture, an infliction of pain that permeated my bone marrow - and it is so perhaps because I'm a History graduate who could not help but notice the many goofs in the plot, acting and battle choreography gone bad. The colonial officers didn't sound British. The dialogue was plain, so much on the surface. How many holes were dug to sink this movie? And coming from an ace 'Nollywood' director I root for, I'm disappointed.

Why on God's green earth was there a 1960s transistorized shortwave radio beside someone wearing a white uniform with a modern day Anarchist logo on his shoulder...I could go on and on, and I'm appalled by the many things not gotten right here because this subject was my term paper in my third year and I had an A in this course (blowing my trumpets? No!) - all I'm saying is that the director, who was also the writer and other crew members, could do better. This was meant to be a historical fiction that was meant to expose the thievery of the British colonial administrators (and their callous pilfering of the Great and sophisticated Benin Empire) but it didn't do justice.

Lancelot could have done better even with the limitations.

My verdict: this movie needs a remake! A remake!",1
"Don't waste your time
Did not watch all of this crap. Not even second rate, obviously racially inclined crap from an African nation with no film industry I am aware of, and translated from Afrikaans, does not sound right in English. Even the so-called British colonial uniforms look definitely more Dutch than British and the dialogue is terrible.",1
"My goodness

How bad can a movie be? Probably the worst acting ever in a movie which seems to be made with enough money. Netflix what were you thinking? More viewers in Africa?",1
"Very disappointed

Fighting scenes are like a joke. Effects are horrible cz there are none. A great story ruined by really bad writing and really bad acting. Really disappointed.",1
"So disapppointed.

Some acting moments from main actors (king and Amina), but the supporting actor (Maladi), hard to tell if he is comic relief because his role should be serious. Some really good scenic shots but many that look like a stage. Some of the costumes look like I could make them from my own craft stash and fabric remenants, making me doubt how much they represent the time period. The speaking with accents was labored by almost all actors. The real bummer is this movie could be so good with with the story but this rendition isn't. I would love to see it remade.",1
"Worst ever movie- future cult classic?!

My Indian wife and I managed around 20 minutes before giving up....definitely the most utterly ludicrous film either of us have ever seen. Embarrassed laughter throughout from the first moments. Just dreadful, awful, trash....why on earth was this ever made?! But who knows....maybe this is SO bad that it just might become some kind of cult classic!!",1
"Worst
It is like pig's potty. Time waste. Useless comedy. Unlogical concept.",1
"Where do I begin?

Okay, from the onset, the movie was a disaster. The script is awful, the directing is awful and the actors a so awful. You can use the 2 hours to do something better. Netflix really just be funding any script this days.",1
"Absolute No!

The story is one of the most cliché storylines from late 80s and early 90s nonsensical rom-coms which made absolutely no sense whatsoever. The only fresh content is portrayal of Black community in a better light in Indian movies which unfortunately they have never done so far. Rest is all ""interracial marriage"" and ""family in between romance"" drama. Do a favour to yourself and don't watch it.",1
"There is no zero to add as rating

By far the cheapest production and worst movie I have ever seen.

I will not try to say mistakes This is a childish production elementary school level.",1
"As well-intentioned as it is thoroughly inept, Black November would be a serious contender for year-end worst lists if it weren’t so painfully noble and since",1
"DULL STORYLINE

One of the worst Nigerian movies I have watched in a while. Cliche storyline, poor transition, low budget movie. I was really disappointed. However, I tried to see the movie through in view of a plotwist, but I stopped watching about 15 minutes to the end as I felt my time had been wasted enough. The only positive was the picture quality.",1
"Utter rubbish

It's very rare that I give up on a film - I'm a 'Netflix junkie' and have watched hundreds and hundreds of movies over the past few years. I'm generally quite tolerant of dodgy special effects or bad acting or a plot so thin it becomes meaningless. I could probably count on my fingers the number of films I have abandoned, but sometimes you just have to draw the line and I couldn't finish this, gave up after 30mins. Don't waste your time.",1
"Was going to rate it a 7 but....

With a abrubt ending it destroyed the whole movie. Maybe the money were used up, i don't know. Could have been so good but nooo!!",1
"Sorry, very poor in all aspects

Lots of people have been bigging up this Nigerian movie on social media so I decided to give it a go and watch it recently. What a terrible waste of almost 2hrs of my life. Where do I start the review from? Acting? Poor. Storyline? Probably passable. Sequence of events? Terrible. Script? Laughable. Ending? I don't know if that is Nollywood's idea of a cliffhanger ending, one without a story conclusion. Making us look forward to ""Part 2""? God forbid. I thought quality of movies being churned out in Nollywood has gone up but this just confirms that there is a very long way to go.",1

"snooze fest, not much story, ridiculous soundtracks

The movie has only one boring story, forcibly stretched to.2 hours of run time, which could really have been 30 min. There is no single scene that is interesting in the movie. It is terribly boring that you will struggle to keep awake. The soundtracks do not match the scenes. The movie is full of random soundtracks. I can't believe the high ratings. I wanted to give 0 star if I could. I feel extremely generous to give 1 star.",1
not recommended. With zero originality and even less authenticity. 'Before Valentine' is nollywood's verion of 'the Barbershop' and it stinks,1
"Huh?

Just what were they thinking with this ""movie"". It is probably one of the worst things I have seen in decades, fragmented storyline, completely ridiculous premise and the acting is some of the most painful I've seen. ""power of 1"" gets a 1 rating, ONLY because IMDB does not have a zero rating or -1. Also that finger in the air symbol is a gang sing for a handgun, nice image to put on a movie poster. Don't waste your time with this.",1
"Worst remake

How could they get it so wrong? Despite all the technical innovations that weren't available to Amaka Igwe in 1995, she was still able to create a classic. Noah somehow managed to detribalize a well known classic ethnic movie that had enthralled its audience with its language and culture. The actors were sub par at best. There was poor directing at the beginning during Ahannas flashbacks when he witnessed a man being set ablaze. The man who was set on fire didn't act realistically,he remained really calm despite being on fire. This was one of many directing mistakes that could be identified in the movie.",1
watching this movie is as bad as eating spoilt beans,1

Some powerful performances by the Nollywood actors. Danny Glover offers penetrating rays of sunlight to all his scenes (as you would expect).

Got some beat and base but goes dry now and then, however neat film. Pass the evening well with this melodrama and a bag of popcorn.

"Dreadful

I am baffled that Netflix would subject its audience to this kind of low budget rubbish.

The script is boring and without substance, the main theme of the movie doesn't start until the last 20 minutes of the film. The main theme, i.e. the crash and events leading up to it, were rushed and offered no details on how the crew handled the issue - I certainly hope that the Dana crew were a little more proactive than these two. The pilot uniforms looked like they were made by a toddler, the epaulets looked were yellow tape glued on top of black tape - really?, the director couldn't be bothered to borrow some epaulets or even a uniform from a line pilot. The whole thing is amateurish. Any High School film student or Youtuber would make a better film than this abhorrent junk.",1

I honestly do try and see the best in films and hate to give anything a bad review.

When I saw Deranged come up in my Netflix coming soon list, I immediately added it to my viewing list for when it was to be released. Obviously the title and brief synopsis drew me to wanting to watch it.

Within the first 5 minutes I knew what I was in for.

What a mess. I understand they were probably doing the best with what they had, but I really can not find anything redeeming to say about this film.

Like I said, I hate to give blatant bad reviews, as I know the work that goes into making a film.

Maybe you might enjoy it, I'm not saying don't watch it. But we've seen the whole fatal affair thing so many times and Deranged brings nothing new to the table.",1

This was meant to be a historical fiction that was meant to expose the thievery of the British colonial administrators (and their callous pilfering of the Great and sophisticated Benin Empire) but it didn't do justice.

Lancelot could have done better even with the limitations.

My verdict: this movie needs a remake! A remake!",1
"Dumbest TV Show Ever

"One of the worst Movies I've ever watched

It starts with the animation of the first studio right at the very beginning. So 1995 and cheap, that I kina felt what the movie will look like. Nearly everything is cheap in that movie. Story Actors Real heli (drone) shots mixed up with 1995 cgi helo shots And the directing is bad There is nearly no continuity invetwern the shots when going from overshoulder to the other side The 180 rule is not available but in a mean confusing way

How can such a production be aired on Netflix?",1
"People Failing to Re-Make ""The Man Who Knew Too Little""

This movie was so poorly made that I only got through the first half hour (or so); after trying twice.

The acting was very poor. The actors, also seemed to not know what language they were supposed to be speaking. Often sentences were only part English.

The opening scene looks like they are playing ""Red Light - Green Light,"" with the criminal.

The events that are used to drive the plot are way too coincidental (and, at times, confusing).

The indoor scenes look they were shot on a cellular telephone, in someone's living room. The lighting was flat; and the set looked heavily staged.

There is no urgency, on the part of the police, who are supposed to be concerned about stopping an assassination. Also, very little about how the police conduct themselves is realistic and/or professional.",1

"Finally saw the film, and to understate my aversion for what was on display on my phone's screen for about an hour 35 mins, it yearns for so much ð~. From poor directing, to crap story; questionable acting to illogicality; shallow sceenwriting to bad editing... The film set out to tranverse a potentially-rewarding terrain hitherto unexplored in Nollywood - the story of a lady trying to keep her father's trans company afloat is a welcome one - but it failed woefully in complexifying its conflict and offering didactic lessons to people seeking redemption from their business tribulations ð¤"". Hence, it ended up becoming a vehicle that misses its route, decides to follow the path of other nollywood films and then tries to create the illusive impression of being different from the rest.â~  Genevieve's directing of the film was decent according to Nollywood standards, but the International audience of filmmakers will be sceptical about the director's credentials when thry see the film. But I understand Geny, she's an actor transitioning to directing. When I started watching the film, I saw five people credited as the screenwriters for the film. One of them, CJ Obasi, is a man I respect his radical tendencies in the industry. So, that upped my enthusiasm about seeing the film. Fast-forward one and half hour later, and I'm asking myself, how much research was done in the writing of this filmð§?? I wont be surprised if it's zilch. The dialogues are hardly thought-provoking, lots of unnecessary characters (Phyno's, Peter Okoye etc) who's roles are hardly explored nor add anything to the central case. I'm still pondering how that conversation between Geny's character and Alhaji Maikano and then Maikano/Edochie's character resulted in Maikano's decision to agree a merger with a company defaulting on its loan and agree to clear its 950 million debt. The people that wrote that script crucified sound screenwriting, logic and reality.â? The film made little effort to clear dark corners in the stories, thereby leaving itself with enormous plot holes big enough to damage a LION'S HEART. I could go on and on pinpointing loop holes in the elements about the film, but suffice to say that although the film left me begging for more, I wouldn't stop short of acknowledging the originality given to the characters. Edochie and Osuofia's characters gave me all I needed from a typical traditional Igbo man runnning a transport business. But generally the script failed to explore the characters to provide us with motivations behind their actions... cc: Ikeagwu's resolve to see the company sold. ð¤·ð? 1/4â?â(TM), The local feel was fun: the area boys/agberos in the opening scene made me laugh.",1
The movie is overrated and wasn't what I expected at all,1

The ratings should even be a negative because I just couldn't believe the utter crap they produced!",1

Not worth your time or mine, skip by all means.",1
This was bad in so many ways,1
"With the movie being available on Netflix I expected it had a certain level of quality. However, in my opinion this is not Netflix worthy.

The movie has only one boring story, forcibly stretched to.2 hours of run time, which could really have been 30 min. There is no single scene that is interesting in the movie.

The production is sub-Lifetime movie in all respects, including a wall-to-wall score of elevator music, ridiculous day-glow costuming and the sort of shorthanded opulence in set design that insults both the characters and the audience. This film had the rare distinction of forcing me to re-evaluate  80’s era TV movies based on Sidney Sheldon potboilers (e.g. Rage of Angels) as high water markers to distract me from what is happening on screen.

Come on, we have enough English language films already. Embrace your own language and culture and let your piece be known for what it is rather than in which language it's being delivered to appeal to your audience. This film's setting is in Nigeria, yet everybody speaks fluent English, even the lower class society: as per shown in this film, the parents of the main cast. Make it make sense.

I dropped it before it goes past the 20 mins mark. May not be everyone else's issue, but it is a huge deal for me. Saw some reviews saying the film is moving, yea it moved me to watch another film.",1

"this is one of the worst films i’ve seen in a while. i need nigerians to hang up this, ‘he was led astray/drugs and alcohol’ tales. this absolutely no technique. no flair. plus the actors have the worst case of overacting i’ve ever seen. wow this was awful",1
"“Please, go inside the house, pack your things, and leave this house. NOW!”

One of the best bad movies I have ever seen. It is wildly embarrassing, hilarious and just poorly done. The acting is atrocious, but oh my god is the actress that plays the mother so funny. Her freak out goes down as one of the best of all time. It fails to tell a compelling story about drug addiction or the corruption of a teenager. Instead, we spend an hour with every other character as they argue and yell, and Nimbe just sits there. I swear, this has the making to be the next “The Room”. 

The similarities are uncanny. A failed storyline that is meant to be taken seriously. Horrible and quotable lines. Atrocious acting. Bad direction. The worst set design, with couches and chairs stuck together in the same room that actors trip over them. Different cameras that switch between different exposure levels. Color grading disaster. Bad blood effects. Embarrassing needle drops out of nowhere. The use of a gun in the end. Pointless side characters. I am in love and hate all at once. 

I implore everyone to watch this masterpiece. Please watch it on Netflix (at least in Canada) or anywhere you can find it. Support these filmmakers putting their heart and soul into something, despite it being a failure. I hope they do more. This was my magical discovery, thank you Matt for showing this to me.",1
not recommended for sane people,1
"I got 25 minutes in and I couldn't handle it anymore. It was so painful to watch. Pick an aspect of what makes a movie, it was grating. The abusive husband acting like such a cartoon character, I couldn't help laughing until he started abusing the wife.

What is this movie trying to be? A woman was running away from some other woman only to be chased by another woman who was in the trunk of a taxi she just got into, cartoon sound effects during a serious conversation, this list goes on. The whole movie is about this domestic violence coming from a psychopathic cartoon character, at first it was funny and it quickly pissed me off by how disrespectfully they're treating this.

I was tired of it after the first 10 minutes, the hilariously awful nature of this wore off fast and I have no reason to continue watching this. It's not so-bad-it's-good, it's just horrible.
",1
"Asides from being terribly predictable and featuring generally below average acting, it is plagued by a be-fumbling series of subpar attempts at recreating worn out crime caper staples. These grotesque failures promise to make 'Zero Hour' a harrowing watch for any veteran of Hollywood crime thrillers or investigative dramas. Don't waste your money paying a premium to see this antiquated stockpile of pretentious grot.",1
" 'Big Fat Lie' isn't just not funny, it is terribly sub-standard too. Terribly sub-standard. Oh yuck! Horrible movie. Horrible acting. Horrible production. Horrible story-telling. Everything just wishy washy. The producers of 'Big Fat Lie' obviously have no respect for you; the Nigerian cinema consumer. Please don't waste your money on them. Seeing this movie is like taking a trip into somebody's bad dream. Complete rubbish. Arrrgh",1
"The Call' is awesomely retarded. But that's not how it earned that ""Not recommended"". It is not recommended because; despite what is admittedly very crispy production, ultimately 'The Call' plays like just another run-of-the-mill Yoruba-Nolly comedy: You know those legacy Yoruba comic flicks that are typically packed with characters obviously acting retarded through a series of nonsensical scenarios, ensuring they will annoy more than amuse anyone looking for sophisticated and subliminal comedy.",1
"Knock Out Blessing' is an utterly useless movie that ought not to have been made, or at least not released to the public. So boring and lifeless, it was a real struggle staying awake whilst seeing it. Probably, the only good thing here was watching Demola Adedoyin perfectly play a one eyed assassin. Asides that, the trailer of 'Knock Out Blessing' is a million times more interesting than 'Knock Out Blessing'. You will do well to avoid this, for life. Rubbish!",1
"That Which Binds Us' is utterly useless- Bad in every way bad can be. Paying to see it is tantamount to buying frustration. Such an affront, this movie is sweltering pain. By all means, avoid it. Lest it drives you mad with its assemblage of abhorrently forceful acting performances, amateurish story-telling and subpar production.",1

"Profoundly irritating and annoying, 'Boss of All Bosses' could very well be, the worst Nollywood movie we have ever seen in cinema.

"The Ghost and the Tout' was let down by slack story telling, excessive over-acting and all round lacklustre performances. We didn't hate it, but we most definitely didn't find it funny. Like a tout, it was forceful. It was brash. Predictable and just too obvious.",1
"Fresh. Bold. Salacious. Illogical. Dissatisfying. 'Date Night' is different and its freshness is a bonafide attention grabber as evidenced by the uproar of anticipation and intrigue it created in viewers. Unfortunately, the movie itself failed to live up to the excitement and curiosity instigated by its trailer.",1
"Love Birds' lacks any originality, substance or thoughtfulness- And it knows this! So it tries unsuccessfully to camouflage these failures by bedazzling its Nigerian audience with out-of-place and unnecessary sceneries of Atlanta, Georgia. Unfortunately, showing beautiful streets of American cities is just not close to being enough to impress today's sophisticated Nigerian audience. It might have worked in the early nineties, but such laziness most definitely won't fly in 2018.",1
Retarded. Gratuitous. And senseless. The only thing funny about 'Divorce not allowed'; is that it manages to use good production and good acting to produce torturous garbage.,1

"I do not fully recall the story of Amina, but I expected some artistic licence in the storytelling, to provide excitement and entertainment, but it turned out to be really boring story telling. It took me three tries to complete watching the movie. The production is all over the place, and most characters are not fully developed. Perhaps, Amina would have been better as a limited series to fully capture the essence of the story. ",1
"This is a story of pain, waiting and hope, but it is sometimes confusing. We don’t quite understand what we are seeing, and the stories are all jumbled.",1
"Technically, The Wait provides great picture quality, but the lighting is not great. Many connections and transitions are not smooth or realistic. We see a scene where a lady smirks while overhearing a man’s conversation several seats away. It reminds her of a painful experience and the next time they meet, he talks about her leaving the restaurant because of him. It is too much of a reach.
",1
"The Wait is full of stars, but it does not shine bright. It is like tasting a glass of wine that has not fully developed, perhaps, made with unripe grapes. It is a movie full of emotions and feelings, but that is almost all you get. There is practically no entertainment. The story revolves around couples looking for children.

One couple has had multiple miscarriages and this has made her lose her initial faith. Another couple has never had a child, and are facing pressures on all fronts. There is an unemployed graduate waiting for the perfect job. All of them connected together by a gynaecologist who is waiting for a life partner. They are all waiting in the waiting room of life. 

Working with the script they have, the actors interpret the characters to the best of their abilities, but this is one movie that shows that not all books translate well  into movies. Movies and books are characterized by conflict resolution, there is no real conflict to resolve in the Wait. The result is that this is almost a snooze fest.  ",1
"The movie has surprises that have no connection to anything. For example, someone pulls a gun in a social situation, and he gives the excuse that he is in the force. Yet, for the duration of the movie, we never see him in uniform or at work. Also, apart from the drivers and maids, we do not see any of the characters go to work, or their source of income captured, yet they are spending money.",1
"Broda Shaggi and Mr. Macaroni are lessons in showing that doing comedy skits on social media following is not necessarily going to translate to skilled acting. Broda Shaggi can’t seem to break out of the mould of the loudmouth in a movie. 

An ecample of a character who does not fit the role in this movie is Tope Tedela. In his role as a semi-literate mai-suya, he is too refined and too well spoken.",1
"The storyline is shoddy and has misplaced and unfunny jokes. There is unnecessary and unprovoked violence, which adds nothing to the plot or acting. Some of the most important parts that could have added flesh to the movie are done with music, and so lose their impact. Some other pivotal scenes were done without dialogue. ",1
"This movie feels like a mish mash of under-developed ideas with a half hearted romance thrown in. It is not sure if it wants to be a comedy or a satire. As slapstick comedy, it falls short of the expected full-on laughter and ridiculousness. As a satire, it does not have enough ingredients and irony to truly carry that flag. It is full of social media slangs, trending hashtags, and the worst of poverty cliches. ",1
"The movie had no redeeming quality. Not even the costume or cinematography made up for the poor storyline and acting.

When the lights came on at the end of the movie, we got some real laughter: a number of people were fast asleep. Someone voiced out the sentiment that we deserved a refund of our ticket fees. Clearly, I wasn’t alone.",1
"Easy Gold was designed to be a slapstick comedy, but the storyline did not slap, neither did the comedy stick.  I struggled to find any real laughter. Apart from Blossom’s acting, the rest of the cast was unreal.

The movie plot was all over the place; the supposed twists beggared belief. We all know comedies ask you to suspend some measure of belief in order to enjoy the humour, but this movie was too unrealistic and I could not relate with it.

No matter how funny a comedy is, it would have some serious scenes to tie the story together and pull at your heart strings, and give you some break from the continual laughter. This movie failed woefully even in this aspect.  The serious scenes were unbelievable, and the acting in those scenes seemed like the actors were in a high school play.",1
"Hogwash! Seeing this movie was such a pain. There's absolutely nothing good to be said about 'Alakada Reloaded'. A pretentious contraption- Like a Frankenstein soup, there's no logic behind its forceful comedy. A money sink- With all the hype 'Alakada Reloaded' is a near perfect example of ""Click Bait"". With distinctively hapless acting, a particularly unimaginative story-line and lazy scripting, 'Alakada Reloaded' is most definitely a scam",1
"if I said to you, that this was a spectacular movie, I would be telling a lie. 'Suru l' ere' isn't spectacular. It doesn't even come close to being spectacular. I thought it was boring as hell. However, while seeing this at the cinema, I did witness quite a number of people in the audience seemingly having a good time, as per they seemed to be laughing genuinely. And that is the only reason why this doesn't have a BIG RED WARNING sign right next to it. Cus, maybe it's just me. But, sincerely, I don't think it's worth a cinema see. And believe me, I hate the times when I have to give negative reviews about Nollywood flicks. But I have to say it like I feel it.",1
"'Suru l' ere' is crappy. That is the truth. In a very sub-standard one-trick pony kind of way. The comedy it offers, right from the start, is terribly contrived, terribly predictable and terribly not funny. 'Suru l' ere' is lame, from start to finish. I swear, I fell asleep at a point. It was that bad.",1

At an hour and a half running time, 'Deep Fever' is one long, boring and arduous chore to finish. An complete waste of resources; it tells a story that ultimately shouldn't have been told. By all means avoid it and for good reason too!",1
"The sound quality of the movie was not crisp, and that contributed to the less than desirable experience. The story could have been better executed with better laughs, as unrealistic as it was. This could have made up for everything else it lacks, but even that was too much to ask for in this production.",1
"The plot was totally unrealistic and it was all over the place. The editing, especially with flashbacks, was disjointed, leaving the viewer confused. There was a lot of shouting in the movie, sometimes making it difficult to hear and understand the actors, not to mention that the shouting was pointless.",1
"Tanwa Savage is supposed to be a slapstick comedy that addresses what happens when a man is under pressure to have a baby. The comedy did not slap, and the punchlines were weak and too tepid to elicit laughs from the audience.

I really looked forward to seeing the movie because it has Bimbo Ademoye as headliner, but even her role could not redeem the movie for me. She has a certain spark and energy that I could not feel in this movie.",1
"Watching Ratnik was quite painful. I was almost in tears. I acknowledge that the movie had lofty ambitions, but I am convinced it would have fared better as a 10 to 30 minute short movie to test the waters. Hopefully, the producers and script writers will take criticism in good faith and use it to deliver a much better flick next time. ",1
"But the sound was not always good. In a few scenes, we see the lips moving but hear no sounds – only for the sounds to catch up later.

While I do not recall the plot and story of the original movie, this particular story was all over the place, and it was disjointed here and there.",1

We admit that the chemistry between characters and actors in 'The Millions' was sublime, ensuring that the comedy worked well and hence didn't feel forced. But there's just something very off putting about watching Ramsey Nouah forming George Clooney, Blossom Chukwujekwu forming Brad Pitt, AY forming Don Cheadle. And Nancy Isime channeling her very her own Julia Roberts. All in a Nollywood movie faking 'Ocean's Eleven'. Eerily off putting, we found it to be. Maybe you won't.

Not fantastic. It's entertaining. Not spectacular.,1
"And it's so sad, because if you read the synopsis alone, you will instantly become excited. How they managed to fumble it is beyond reason. Points to a complete drought of talent which inevitably results in horrible acting and horrible story-telling in tow. There wasn't a single person that wasn't insulting this as we trooped out. Even cinema staffers who didn't pay, were hissing. Horrible.",1
"Fifty minutes is spent advertising a holiday resort in Lagos, which stars as both ""the real"" subject matter of 'Clustered Colours' and the movie-location. The producers will call it ""character development"". We call it a kidnap- Held hostage for fifty odd minutes, we were forced on an excursion of the resort grounds, making stops at the tennis court, the football pitch, the gym and swimming pool area that have nothing to do with the movie. After which the short ""play"" occurs. Then we spend the last twenty minutes watching the actors dance to music by Tosin Martins and other artistes. That's it! Movie closes. Money down the drain. Not recommended.",1
"Ultimately, this is a crappy offering that shouldn't have been brought to cinema. It would have fared better opening on IrokoTv or African Magic Urban. We suggest you wait for it to get there, but.

Not recommended. We hated it immensel",1

If you dare to, you will find that the second your pop corn is finished, all that will be left for you to chew on is teeth grinding regret. With its ridiculous story, clunky production, terrible acting and lifeless dialogue, 'Blind Spot' will send you spiraling into an abyss of anguish and pain from whence you will not recover till it's over.",1

"Dagger' is closer in acting, production and story-telling to NTA soap operas from the early nineties (think 'Fortunes' or 'Ripples') than it is to what we have come to expect from Nollywood of 2017 in cinema. Amidst shabby production and wobbly acting, 'Dagger' tells an unoriginal story in an unoriginal way, complete with unoriginal twists and turns, so much so it ends up feeling jumbled, broken and antiquated.",1
"To stand any chance of eking out the slightest fun from this, you would have to see it for free, at a time when you have absolutely nothing else in the world to do- Like in the rare case that just when your home goes out of electricity, a friend insistently offers you a cinema treat and you have seen 'The Bridge', 'Potato Potahto', 'A Bad Moms Christmas' and even 'Daddy's Home 2'. In the absence of such a perfect storm, avoid stabbing your wallet in the heart with this 'Dagger'.

Afterwards, you spend the remainder of the film trying to figure out what it's even about. And at the end, you're just so sad for wasting your time.

No one deserves to see ""Ghetto Bred,"" at least, not with their hard-earned money.",1

"The first major problem with this movie would have to be our lead actor, Idia Aisien who plays Nneka. Nneka is supposed to be a character that is fluent in Igbo, however, Idia’s grasp of the language is surprisingly worse than her Yoruba co-actress (Bimbo Ademoye). But if the struggle ended with the inability to speak a language that would be one thing. The other thing is actual performance. Idia never really gets to a point where you are convinced that she is the character. She is constantly ‘becoming’ or ‘attempting to be’ the character.

When you support poor quality movies, you encourage mediocrity and the local industry won't just grow. The story though uninteresting is quite very disjointed.

Unnecessary scenes and below par acting by some characters. The only good thing here is the good cameras and picture quality the production came out with.",2

"A travesty

Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Half of a Yellow Sun is a great, heart breaking novel; an evocation of four beautifully drawn, vivid characters whose lives are forever changed by the brutalities of the Biafran struggle, the Nigerian civil war. The opening few chapters draw us into the background against which the book's central characters must stand; the eventually disastrous effects of British colonialism, the contemptuous racism of the British ex pats, the depth and beauty of Igbo-Ukwu art, the enmity between the different peoples of Nigeria, the corruption, and the struggle for African identity, for self-determination and independence. This film replaces a superbly written, perfectly paced introduction with a single scene, that reduces one of the book's most complex meetings into two shots and a couple of lines of dialog. In short this film is so rushed, so much of a squeezed accordion, with no idea of what themes to lift from the page, that it renders the events confused, meaningless and, for those of us who gave read the book, entirely, unavoidably comical. It must go down as one of the worst cinematic adaptations of a book ever. How one could take such fabulous source material and produce such a hare-brained précis confounds me. This is a disgrace and an awful disservice to CNA. May Americanah fare better; Half of a Yellow Sun does not deserve this fate. Shame on this ""film"".",2
"Meh
Thank God I read the book. This movie version does not do Chimamanda's story justice at all. They tried to do too much within just this one movie that clearly should have been broken down to capture the MULTIPLE stories within the main plot (I also agree with the miniseries idea). Most of the actors did not fit the roles- Kainene was NOT supposed to be as...open, as she was in the movie, for instance. There was a reason they were written a certain way in the novel, and sadly, whoever produced this movie did not understand this. I couldn't even focus on the movie long enough because the acting was just too cringe-worthy for the most part and the story line was way too superficial. Ugh, I'm so disappointed - READ THE BOOK!",2

The so called Igbo characters also had strong Yoruba characteristics which caused another disconnect and made the characters feel unreal. Film was too long for what it was worth.",2

"Absolute Trash. 1985 Bollywood called, they want their script back.

Take out the Nigeria/India culture part away (there nothing enlightening in the movie about either cultures to begin with) and it is absolute trash. The hero and heroine bump into each other while jogging in slow-mo at the beach, and fall in love. 1985 Bollywood called, they want their script back. Or, think of a movie that Karan Johar would produce, only make it hella cheesy and bad. The director (Indian, who apparently grew up in Nigeria all her life, also cameos in the movie) only seems to have overplayed all sorts of stereotypes, at least the Indian ones for sure. The Nigerian family isn't okay with an Indian groom, the Indian family isn't okay with a Nigerian wife. The director lady shows up and says ""People from other cultures are epic too"" and all the parents are okay with it? Like ""I'm depressed"" Friend: ""Don't be"". Me: ""Oh wow! My depression is gone! Thank you so much!"" It's like she decided to make a movie around that one line and didn't care how bad it was as long as the line made it in. The dialogue between the mothers was cringe-worthy. Failed opportunity for Women's Empowerment: The movie shows the Nigerian dad is upset that his daughter can't (?) look after his law firm and wants her to marry a Nigerian lawyer dude who'll take care of it. The daughter then solves newbie case, with some evidence (that a 15 yr-old would know to get) that her boyfriend requests from another dude because they're bros. So she's bad lawyer to begin with? You could have shown her do the job, but no! Had to get the dudes involved. And then, towards the end, you go on to say how epic of a lawyer she is based on this one case and how she should her dad's law firm? The other villain lady was a better fit to run the company IMO All that said and done, there's FINALLY a cultural exchange between the Indian mom and the Nigerian dad. Indian mom, supposedly progressive, asks for Dowry, ""Pay me because my son married your daughter"" she says. A woman, in 2021, asking for dowry - in a movie supposedly about cultural learning and feminism. WTH? The dad says ""No you're supposed to pay me because you're taking my daughter away"" The director, also a woman, couldn't find ANYTHING else to show from both the cultures? *smh* I can go on but that would be a waste of time. Was hoping to learn more about Nigeria and that people would learn about India. But noooo. Trash movie.",2
"It says this was shot in a month. It looks it!

Cheesier than Disney; badly made. It looks like it was made it a month for sure and was the best at being mediocre.

The only reason i wanted to watch this is I loved the premise of inter-racial romance and the dynamics of the relationship. And i was excited to see a Nollywood movie. I think this is an important story to be told but let down by bad writing and mediocre actors. It felt like i was watching a soap opera and found myself rolling my eyes multiple times

Having watched other romcom Netflix Originals and grown up on Bollywood movies, i wasnt really expecting much.

It felt so forced and artificial. You could ""see"" the actors acting. First sign of a mediocre performance.

The worse was the script, it felt it was written by a student writer. The dialogues were contrived and very artificial.

There was NO CHEMISTRY with any cast members, it seemed like the entire thing was forced and not organic at all.

Wish they had a better writer and performers. Such an awkward movie! I wasn't expecting an Oscar level movie or performance, just your generic Hallmark level expectations, but this was sooo bad.

I'm however interested to see more Nollywood movies to compare to this. I hope they're far superior.",2

This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen, the whole plot premise is not so bad in itself, but the script is sooo lazy the movie could've had lasted just 30 minutes, maybe that way it wouldn't be so damn boring. Not only does the plot fail to grip the viewer's attention, but the acting is the poorest, most unconvincing ever, so while the lead actress cried, I couldn't help but laught at how terrible her acting was. So my review boils down to this: if you want to watch a decent movie, just skip this one up.",2
"The film started out pretty strong, but then it went downhill fast. Its characters (especially Sades) are messy and have many poorly executed emotions and phases of grief or happiness. The movie can be uplifting but it gets ruined by constant unneeded crying. Seriously there is so much crying that it becomes a problem. It is very and i mean a VERY slow film and only starts to begin to get somewhat interesting near the end. So that is why this film (in my opinion) is terribly forgettable.",2

"Interesting premise, terrible script
carguychris23 June 2020
Netflix has recently been airing interesting foreign films, but they're really scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one. The obviously low-rent execution of this film doesn't bother me very much, but the horrid script and wildly uneven acting does.

This film is ostensibly about an airplane crash, but aside from the first 5 minutes and the last 20, it's actually a badly scripted and unevenly acted chamber drama with serious pacing problems. The plot aimlessly meanders between the personal lives of various characters, most of which are so uninteresting that the film feels far longer than its brief 75 minutes (a problem compounded by too many pointless establishing shots of aircraft taxiing - we already know we're at an airport!). The main actors do a good job, but the script often has them prattling aimlessly; minor characters are mere sketches, and many of the performances are cringe-worthy. Speaking of cringing, the attempts at comic relief are so unfunny that I'm unsure whether to even describe them as such, and it's obvious that the filmmakers knew almost nothing about how airliners actually operate.

This film would have been much better had it focused on the crash and on the embezzlement subplot. Attention low-budget filmmakers: in most cases, it's best to choose one interesting idea and focus on that.",2
Dig to stole your time!,2

There is no list of actors. Each episode lacks a synopsis. The episodes don't have subtitles.

"August the First on Reel 13

AUGUST THE FIRST, the Reel 13 Indie from September 13th, is problematic right from the get go. It's hard to dig your teeth into early on, particularly because the characters come at you fast and furious, introduced without any real establishing. I appreciate the attempt at efficiency, but without getting some sense of the characters we are dealing with (and their relationship to one another), nothing has any resonance and it's hard to follow what's going on. It's almost as if the first thirty minutes of the film are awash.

Eventually, the intelligent, careful viewer will start to understand the characters, their desires and motivations. By then, we are knee deep in an immature melodrama, with an accentuation on the ""melo"". The story revolves around the graduation party for Tunde, fresh off his college degree. For his party, Tunde surprises his family by inviting his estranged father from Africa to the party. The family is not pleased and then, yelling and tears naturally ensue. The way that director Lanre Olabisi piles on the pain causes the film to depart from the world of the real (the mother is a drunk and recovering from breast cancer, the sister is pregnant, the aunt is a slut who had an affair with the father  get my drift?). Olabisi tries to combat that by employing an ultra-shaky hand-held technique to add a vitality to the film, but it doesn't remotely mesh with the soap opera leanings of the narrative. If Olabisi wanted to tell this story, I think he needed to embrace the melodrama a la Douglas Sirk and stylize it accordingly.

Then again, CRY FUNNY HAPPY, a film that I loved, has some melodramatic elements and also uses a hand-held camera. The big difference though is the acting. In CRY FUNNY HAPPY, the actors are raw and honest. Here, they seem untrained and are mostly over-the-top and not very believable (Sean Philips and Kerisse Hutchison are the strongest members of the ensemble as the older brother and sister of Tunde). The most intriguing thing about the film is the father character, who shows up at the party unexpectedly. In spite of the actor lumbering around in the character's shoes (D. Rubin Green does not seem very comfortable in the role, particularly in terms of movement  though his accent is believable), he manages to come across as somewhat likable, even though the majority of the family distrusts him greatly. He is a very complex potential villain. His actions are interesting and seem to belie his statements and yet, his manner suggests that his intentions are pure and true. And so there is suspense in trying to determine why the father is really in town and if he really wants to reconnect. There are layers here and this is what the film needed to exploit even further.

However, as the film starts to build this interesting mystery amidst the schmaltz, it then turns around and betrays its audience by ending abruptly. I've always said that I don't need closure, but I do require an ending, if you are able to see the difference. There is not enough of a climax in AUGUST THE FIRST to earn the right to end when it did, which is just another of many amateur attributes that add up to make the film a great disappointment.",2
"The movie left so much to be desired. Oloture jumping out the room window was only the first of several really crappy scenes in the movie. The film's star, Sharon Ooja, who is a wonderful actress was simply here the subject of an artificial and deeply flawed plot. Also, lets not forget the unforgivable music. This movie had an ambition to reflect human trafficking, but fails miserably",2
"Awkward to watch

I didn't hate the film but there wasn't much plot and clearly made on a very low budget.

There are moments where they are filming in public, where passersby are staring right in to the camera which is a big blooper considering it's meant to be a film. The audio frequently dips meaning you can't hear what they are saying. The acting from Okon (Ime Bishop Umoh) is awkward and annoying to watch, with his unnecessary facial expressions. There points where English characters are speaking, but their lines are clearly written by a Nigerian because native Brits would not speak like that. And the majority of the British characters look like they were recruited from a Job centre as they have zero acting skills.

Not sure why I watched the whole thing to be honest.",2

"This movie was a movie that had great potential. A directorial debut of the Famous Nigerian Genevieve, packed with star studded Nigerian Names from Phyno, to Pete edochie. It also Had really fantastic production value, however that's as far as positives go. One thing that a good movie needs above all else is ""story"". the story usually sets actors up for fantastic pe formances, can usually be the thing to sell a movie. However, this failed to be anything other than boring. It had no logical flow. It was trying to do a lot of things, like develop a love interest for Genevieve, set her up as a hardworking female, however it offers nothing in terms of bringing that to life. There should have been more connections to the characters, like what does Lionheart mean ?? Who exactly are these characters. It feels very empty and quickly put together. Building on from that, another thing that makes movie so terrible is, because the story is terrible the actors cannot live up to their potential. They're stuck in a bad story, so there's nothing to immerse themselves in. The film also has terrible writing which also contributes to the actor's terrible performances. I don't know who wrote this but it was really off the mark for writing. Some of the dialogue was so superficial and empty. They threw in some inspirational words here and there to try and do soemthing but it had no effect because they hadn't prepared for it properly. There was also a serious lack of research witht the writing. When you borrow 950 million naira,which is basically 2.6 million dollars, no company takes that kind of loan and pays back fully in a year. People pay interests on that loan, so that really messed up the story and writing. Also was the evil coworker a board member ?? What was he doing at those meetings ?? And how can a company which has a board be unaware of a 2.6 million dollar loan. It's jsust not possible, that's not how business works. It feels as if real life was bent to fit the terrible narrative this movie was trying to tell. The only positive of this movie is production value. The cinematography is average holly wood standard, although it falters a lot. It's evident of a quite low budget Hollywood movie. It's netflix quality, let me put it that way in terms of original content. However, it still needs to improve. I think Genevieve needs to go on a masters in directing from a good film school to understand how to properly direct, it is really important she does that. In conclusion, this was a movie that could have been groundbreaking in terms of Nigeria's first original Netflix content. However m perhaps shockingly, seeing as it was bought by Netflix, it was absolutely poor. And writing, bad story, bad acting. I can only congratulate the production value of this.",2

Mofe ni Mofe' is a typical Yoruba movie made for African Magic Yoruba or even more appropriately; YouTube. It has no business in cinema.,2
"Small Chops' is an awesomely stupid movie that is not worth paying premium for. In all fairness this movie should have been gently released on Iroko TV; definitely not in cinema. Following the now well established formula often used by counterfeit movie makers where they employ a flood of ""beloved"" comedians to mask the retardation of their movie and their own complete lack of talent, 'Small Chops' proves for all intents and purposes, to be two movies in one:",2
Special Jollof' is yet another cold turkey from Nollywood in Diaspora. And as usual; it is highlighted by a yéyé story and a plethora of half hearted acting performances. There's nothing to see here. It's a total waste of money and time.,2
" As far as comedy goes, 'Your Excellency' is a corpse. A freshly deceased corpse, it has only a few spasms of laughs to offer - A quip here and a giggle there, for most part however, it rendered the hall; Graveyard Silent. Its, was a story of gigantic failures; misfire after misfire, scene after scene closed to the tune of hissy echoes rather than ""LOLs"".",2
"The Enemy I know' is an extremely lazy concoction. Everything about it is below par - even the ""police woman"" shows the back of her I.D card whilst effecting an arrest - whereas; this is 2019 and ""Aki & Paw Paw"" mistakes such as this are untenable in cinema. Ridiculous!",2
"Social Media 101' is lazily unoriginal. This is the handiwork of an ideas pirate; someone who plagiarizes the creative ideas of others, makes them his own and seeks to profit from same. Plagiarism! That is the stuff 'Social Media 101' is made of. The producers put not an iota of creativity into making this a movie.",2
"They just sewed together different jokes, memes and videos of little known comics that have gone viral on Nigerian social media, called it their own movie and brought it to cinema. If you are Big on social media, you will have seen many of them, many times before. And you are not likely to find them to be very funny here as the producers even fail to excel at plagiarism, leaving 'Social Media 101' plagued by bottom of the barrel acting, very boring dialogue and particularly horrible scene lighting. This is all round ridiculous!",2
"Utterly not recommended. 'My London Slave' is complete hogwash. A total waste of money. There's no way you go in to see this and come out happy. Because, everything about this sham of a movie is calculated to irritate you. And it will. Please, don't pay for misery.",2
"Father of Today' is just too basic to be in cinema. It's not horrible as to be completely unwatchable. It's just too basic. Literally, everything in 'Father of Today' is skin and bones, bear minimum, ground floor basic. The acting is leisurely. Production feels home made. And the story-telling is very amateurish.",2
"Not recommended for anybody. Not even children. Very irritating movie, 'Another Father's Day' will leave you with a migraine. With terrible acting and an outstandingly imbecilic story-line, this ridiculous low grade Disney wannabe excuse of a comedy will make anyone and everyone lose interest in Nollywood forever. Such a sham. And a terrible waste, this is what comes of writing stories and producing movies with the sole intention of advertising an amusement park, but people shouldn't have to pay to watch long-form adverts. We strongly suggest you stay far away from this filth if you value your time and energy.",2
"Made in Heaven' is a stupid movie. It is so stupid, it will irritate you to the point you will start laughing out of sheer frustration. You will grow so weary seeing it, you will suddenly find yourself feeling as though you just might be enjoying the foolishness of this foolish movie. Very ridiculous movie. Complete rubbish!",2
"Such a shame really. We saw this earlier today, with a small audience of ladies and guys; couples and individuals alike- The irritation in the hall was uniform. So it was that; as we trooped out of the hall, unusually, standing at the door was a lady, we suspect she works for the cinema. She asked everyone together: ""What did you think about the movie?"" And as if rehearsed, the phrases ""Rubbish movie"" and ""Very stupid"" immediately rent the air, echoing from one person to the next. We were not surprised. Because you see, the biggest shame here is that we predicted this would happen.",2
"Possibly one of the worst films I've ever seen.

Warning: Spoilers
I've been watching movies since probably 2002 (I'm 16 now BTW), and couldn't clarify which movie was the worst I ever had to sit through. Then 15 yrs. later, I see this on Netflix in the ""Recently Added"" section, and I wanted to watch it. Yes, it sucks!!! It's possibly one of the worst movies I ever watched in my entire life. Let's start with the music. It's like ""nails scratching on a chalkboard"". Also, the husband's acting sucks bird feces!! Also, the pregnant wife's friend whatever, I wanted to slap her so hard in the face. And OMG, the wife's screams. Annoying than Tara Reid in the horror movies she's in (Urban Legend) for example. It just screams ""porn"" throughout the whole movie. Screw Netflix for adding these Nigerian, Chinese, or Indian flicks.",2
"I gave it 2 because I'm kind!

This is.... Aaaahahahaha :) THIS is a joke. This is how netflix trolls us. Brilliant joke on us!",2
"mean-spirited, unfunny, kinda classist. you’d think someone with a background in music video directing would turn in something that has more than zero visual ideas but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",2
"Such a dissappointing rendition of a beautiful book.

I wasn't expecting it to be amazing in the first place but I wasn't expecting it to be this bad.

I feel like Thandie and Chiwetel tried so hard to act like Nigerians that they just flopped.

Just didn't work at all. No wonder I hadn't even heard of it til Emirates reccommended it.",2
"bad acting, stiff dialogue, and an overuse of a melodramatic soundtrack all come together to make one of the worst and weirdly religious virus movies i’ve ever seen",2
"Nollywood exists because it appeals to a certain demographic that wants to see something they don't get from the American film industry. With the success of Nollywood films, it shows that Nigerians want relationship mellow drama, spiritual and religious themes and grandiose theatrics. As the popularity has increased, they upgraded from no budget, shoddy filmmaking to low budget with better camera work and lighting. That's what I found with Frank Rajah Arase's new film Iyore. It's your typical Nollywood movie, cheating, ancestral folklore, bad acting but with real production value.

Iyore tells the story of a sacrificial virgin and her lover back in the early days of the Benin Kingdom, running away and now in the present day they're ancestors are dealing with similar transgression. It's quite difficult to write a summary because there are so many characters with motivations I couldn't understand. The connection between the past and present wasn't clear at all. Some of the lead performances were decent but most laughably over the top. I maybe would have enjoyed it more if gathered with friends, making fun of the poorly written dialogue and pregnant pauses but instead I was in a dark theater bored out of my mind.

Highlight: there is one legitimately funny scene of a villager bribing the prince which was well heightened and earned my laughs.

Lowlight: every repeated scene where a character had to restate either that they were in love with some or not cheating on someone.",2
"
This script reminds me of the racism of the Hollywood movies of the first half of the 20th century. It just happens that the good guys are brown skinned, and the bad guys are white skinned. And the writer seems to be not only mildly racist, but also very nationalist: oh, look of the ugly airport customs check, forgetting that Nigeria is the same plus some excessive corruption and military and police violence",2
I skimmed this. no way i’m watching the whole thing,2
"Anyone who tells you this is hilarious is lying. The premise is very promising: A Nigerian Christian sect made the film to warn people about the influences of witches in Nigerian society. It seems witches are everywhere and they can make middle-aged ladies to grow penises or make children plaster shit all over their faces.

Unfortunately it's exactly like some other Nigerian films I've seen: a lot of standing around and talking in semi-empty rooms, you can't hear what the people are saying as the microphone is located in another room or possibly another city altogether and in general it's just dull.

It's funny at some points, yes, especially in the beginning, and it's interesting to see what kind of beliefs people hold in other parts of the world but otherwise watching this was as fun as going to a dentist. I had to down a half a bottle of whiskey and few beers in quick succession just to get through this which is kind of telling.",2
"Interesting premise, but bad execution. Main issue was all of the sexist elements in story, dialogue and camera work. Acting was hit or miss.",2
"They're really sticking with the ham-fisted christian propaganda, just as much as the unnecessarily long takes and terrible audio mixing. The music keeps overpowering the dialogue. They even re-used the same songs and opening credits. Also, for some reason, they got a kid smoking cigarettes and making out with an older woman? How charming.",2
"Though the cinematography looks professional, don't let this film fool you. It's a disaster. Starting with incredibly poor writing, the bonkers plot brings none of the horrors it is constantly talking about and as a result, there's a large exposition problem that further emphasizes the atrocious dialogue. Most of the performances aren't good to begin with but the lead, Swanky J.K.A., is laughably bad. It's very confused and incredibly boring.",2
"Focused as it is on the relationship between Joseph and Suzy, the movie sheds little light on the February 13, 1976, assassination, which brought Olusegan Obasanjo to power.",2
"Despite an intriguing historical setup, '76 struggles to tell a cohesive political story, and loses its thread as the personal subplots overshadow the events of the coup.",2
"I’m not quite sure who this movie is made for. On one hand the film’s themes are clearly intended for children, more specifically little girls, as it deals with the importance of education especially in heavily patriarchal societies. On the other hand the film contains quite graphic displays of child abuse with an incredibly unnecessary rape scene involving a twelve year old girl which rivals Megan is Missing (2009) in levels of pure disgust. 

The entire production is very amateurish, the audio being the worst offender. The ADR is very noticeable as we can constantly hear the background noise of the room it was recorded in. Oftentimes it sounds as though the characters are miles apart when they instead are having a conversation in the same room. This film has one of the worst soundtracks that I’ve ever heard. When it isn’t playing an out of place pop song, it uses some of the most generic stock music that I’ve ever heard which often has the opposite of the intended effect. It rarely fits and sometimes just serves to over-explain what each character is feeling.

The weirdest thing on display here is how the film attempts to explain why the protagonist’s father doesn’t want her to get an education. Typically in these types of movies the explanation is deeply rooted in cultural traditions which is perfectly fine as it allows for a larger audience to connect with it. But in this film her father doesn’t want her to get an education because her mother had gotten one and then turned into a terrible woman. This event is portrayed in multiple flashbacks which show her to be caring and loving before going to school and then changing into an unpleasant woman afterwards. Since we know so little about this character and the only change in her life is that she is now going to school, the film implies that it is the education that changed her attitude which, bizarrely, goes against its very themes. This type of contradiction is actually surprisingly very commonplace in the film. Other than our main character, the school kids are all portrayed as quite stupid and are unable to answer any question that the teacher throws at them no matter how simple. It is shown later that no student was able to get even a decent score on their exams. So the question is, why would you make a film about the importance of education and then proceed to portray it as something which either doesn’t work or turns people into insufferable elitists?

"f you watched Chief Daddy: Going For Broke on its New Year Day release on Netflix and immediately thought it to be a contender for the worst movie of the year, know that the fault isn't yours; its Ebony Life's, Netflix Naija's, Executive Producer Mo Abudu's, Director Niyi Akinmolayan's, and every other person that thought it wise to kick-off our New Year celebrations with this premium disaster of a movie.

Chief Daddy (2018) was flat, but this sequel, Going For Broke, sets such new lows for the pointless franchise that it makes the first one look good.

Chief Daddy 2, in many ways, and like many other overhyped movies from Nollywood in recent memory, felt like a train of Instagram skits slapped onto each other. It's unnecessarily long, disjointed, and pointless. Saddest part is, it doesn't take long after the opening credits roll in for viewers to realize how pointless this almost 2 hours movie is going to be.

A non-existent story, mediocre screenplay, shitty direction behind the camera, and little to no consistency with almost all the characters from the first movie are some of the obvious problems that bedevilled this sequel no one asked for.

Chief Daddy: Going For Broke is a disaster, and that's putting it mildly. Ebony Life had quickly go back to the drawing board and come up with something good because they really need a win right now. Working with Netflix is great for the brand, but disappointing fans like this, in an industry where the standards are already pretty low, doesn't bode well for anyone, even for the ""biggest movie studio"" in Nigeria.


PS: A prequel story of the titular Chief Daddy's road to fame, fortune and polygamy might've had a better output that this pot of confliction we got.",2
"The transitions were awful, score was blatantly bad, story was all over the place",2
"Way too many sub plots got resolved at the end very quickly, some of the drama felt artificial made just to make two characters have some conflict, the characters were fine some were annoying but i think that's by design, sometimes things just happen for the sake of it happening

This is probably just an average movie but at times it was very boring for me although there were some enjoyable elements

"i wanted to watch a bad movie but this shit was CRAZY so many twist and turns, the obvious green screen. Obsessed

"Trying to get a grasp on Nollywood but this film is by far the worst so far and does not encourage further digging. In no filmindustry or country could this be considered ”good”, it just cannot be a case of cultural misunderstanding. 
Cinematography, lightning, sound, art direction, and unfortunately the acting are all sub-any daytime soap of your own choice at any given afternoon in front of your tv. Every one-minute-scene possible to drag out to five minutes is eight minutes long, and before they’re over you forgot where and why they started.",2
So this was long and boring. Not even the narrator from Captain Alex could have saved this one. At least it had a cool poster.,2
"Trite plot, stiff acting, very bad movie",2
"It seems like new Nollywood is just all about cinematography and the number of big names and celebrities the viewers see on screen. Most times, not enough effort is put into storytelling. Our cameras have evolved, but the stories, not so much.
This movie is ridiculous!",2
"Since the begging I was thinking, this may have a strong message just keep it rolling, but it was so bad that it totaly lost the tone of the first scene, that wasn't that good but has so much more to offer.",2

"Classic story of pure belief. Very quick pace but somehow things weren’t coming together. 

I just wondered, these rituals and/practices are very sacred. The fact that Dr Durant was just invited in and shown the ritual was questionable but alas he found what he was looking for.",2
"I had no idea this was going to be a musical. But that makes all the difference. The fact that it's a musical makes it absolutely TERRIBLE. It's like a Disney animated princess movie if all of the charm was removed and the songs were written by scientists or someone who gave equally no shits and was equally unqualified.

There was a ""song"" near the beginning and I couldn't tell if it was supposed to all be one song with dialogue in-between or if they were just switching songs rapidly. It was that disorganized. The various sections sounded totally unrelated to one another until the last one sounded like the first one again and I was like, ""...wait...so was this all one song?"" Just embarrassing. I compare it to Disney because the style of the songs seems like it's trying to be like Disney songs. Except that one time they try to do some acoustic rock song style thing?

And then there's the whole princess story. But it's incredibly poorly written. The dialogue is garbage, the premise is unoriginal, the acting is horrendous, and the plot drags on and on because of unnecessary shitty songs. I was going to turn this off about 20 minutes in, but chose to finish it 100% so that I could write a review about how terrible it is.

THE PEOPLE MUST BE WARNED.

I was surprised that I actually recognized one of the actors, Hakeem Kae-Kazim, and I feel that it's only fair that I mention that he's the only one who doesn't suck at acting, but he isn't great either and I blame this on the directing because I know he can act.

"Fifty minutes is spent advertising a holiday resort in Lagos, which stars as both ""the real"" subject matter of 'Clustered Colours' and the movie-location. The producers will call it ""character development"". We call it a kidnap- Held hostage for fifty odd minutes, we were forced on an excursion of the resort grounds, making stops at the tennis court, the football pitch, the gym and swimming pool area that have nothing to do with the movie. After which the short ""play"" occurs. Then we spend the last twenty minutes watching the actors dance to music by Tosin Martins and other artistes. That's it! Movie closes. Money down the drain. Not recommended.",2
"Night Bus to Lagos' is ""One-Chance"" waiting to happen. Despite being produced by Zeb Ejiro and directed by Chico Ejiro, two Nollywood Goliaths, this 'Night Bus to Lagos' fails to arrive safely. Taking a ride on this derelict contortion characterized by old school film-making techniques, was a terribly discomforting experience for us. Making it seem like; their glory days behind them, ""our fathers"" failed to spend the passing years learning and improving. Consequently, their swords have since grown dull. And their talents, decrepit. Hence, this wreck of a movie plays like a relic straight out of the nineties. A complete waste of money.

"Papa Ajasco comes to cinema in this exceptionally ridiculous and ostentatiously foolish comedy. Amidst a plethora of half-arsed acting performances, terrible production and shoddy editing issues, the only good thing about Papa Ajasco's 'Knockout' is that it was designed intentionally to be ridiculous. And no matter how ridiculous it gets, it is never ashamed to be even more ridiculous.",2
"Guynman' is special. It is specially stupid. And you know, we have seen many stupid movies in our time. You know this. You know. But 'Guynman' is different. It is stupid in a way that is both unique and noteworthy. It is not recommended for intelligent people, anywhere. We will stop here. We will say no more. We are tired. We surrender. Ha! We surrender. We surrender.",2
 'Zero Hour' is most definitely bound to be a Zero for you if you grew up on a respectable diet of Hollywood movies. You will find it practically impossible to feel any remnant of genuine appreciation for this relentlessly shoddy attempt at copycatting olden days Hollywood thrillers. Bleeding Jesus! This movie has less charisma than the 'Third Eye' series from the nineties with Pa Olu Jacobs. Stay away from this.,2
"A sore disappointment, 'Levi' is drama without purpose. Great production. Good acting. No magic. And boring as hell. We wanted so much from this. Maybe we expected too much. Whichever it is, sadly we found 'Levi' to be far from money well spent. Left the cinema weighted down with dejection. There's no life in 'Levi'. It is excruciating to sit through. Sob!",2
"Sista Sista' is yet another colossal waste of money starring Enyimma Nwigwe, making it two crappy movies he has headlined in one weekend. Such a shame that he will allow his brand be used to deceive and cajole his fans into splurging on offerings he ought to have known will most definitely turn out to be end-time disasters. And that is precisely what 'Sista Sista' promises for all those who pay a premium to see it- Unmitigated Disaster!",2
"Knock Out Blessing' is yet another example of a movie made for the consumption of upcoming filmmakers rather than the general public. Like other misguided projects like it, 'Knock Out Blessing' was made primarily for the purpose of massaging its producers' ego rather than pleasing its Nigerian audience. More and more, we are seeing ineffectual movies like these coming to cinemas in Nigeria rather than being packaged as tutorial materials for film making school.",2
"Repetitive and dull, 'Kasala' is the ultimate waste of money, energy and time. Having no other purpose, than to massage the ego of its producers as filmmakers, 'Kasala' is a completely useless movie. A pain inducing potpourri of dire dullness and meaningless rubbish. We guarantee, without an iota of doubt; if you pay a premium to see this movie, you will regret it. And very dearly so. In fact, you will regret it, even if you see it for free. Only your enemies deserve tickets to see this. Don't pay for pain. Run!",2
"Charmed' is not charming. While there's a lot of passion behind it, there's just too little quality to make this a worthy offering. It is amateurish, in every way. With amateurish acting, amateurish editing and an aggravatingly unreasonable story to boot, 'Charmed' is not worth paying a premium for. No how!",2
" If you value your time, work hard to dodge this at a premium. 'Lagos Real Fake Life' is that type of movie you only need to see its trailer to know just how ridiculous it is. And that ""honest"" trailer might be the single best thing about this movie, because if after seeing the trailer you proceed to see 'Lagos Real Fake Life'; you have yourself to blame. From start to finish, 'Lagos Real Fake Life' is a festival of utter ludicrosity- Yet another victim of having tragedians writing comedy.",2
"Bridal Shower' has the singular honour of corralling the worst actresses in contemporary Nollywood in one movie. So much so, we are left to conclude that: having failed to find recognition from their peers and seniors, this league of extraordinarily bad actresses, came together in the spirit of; ""If they won't let us act, we will let ourselves"". For their courage, we congratulate them immensely.

Pulling their resources and bytes of creativity together, they braved the odds to make their very own movie. For name recognition; they called in favors to secure appearances-by-way-of-charity from Big-hearted Toyin Aimakhu Abraham (whose antics were the only thing that got any visible positive reactions from the crowd) and an obviously irritated Helen Paul, whom judging by her demeanor, we suspect was either blackmailed into appearing or was acting on forlorn credit. For chiseled muscles and sturdy abs, they turned to a beleaguered Melvin Oduah.",2
"There's nothing good about 'That Which Binds Us'. Absolutely nothing. Supremely worthless, this movie shouldn't have been made. When it ended, everybody was angry, even non-paying cinema staff. The entire audience literally hissed itself out of the hall.",2
"What Just Happened' is a colossal waste of money! A thoroughly dreadful offering that will leave you feeling full of regret, actually asking yourself- ""What just happened?"" Utter crap! This shabby comedy is hundred percent irritatingly-stupid and barely funny.",2
"The Island' is meaningless, sterile and wacky- An abstract action movie made solely for the sake of the action. Too soulless to be remembered, it is more suited to be seen on Africa Magic.",2
Repetitive. Unimaginative. Childish.,2
"Such a shame with 'Fantastic Numbers'; going by its sophisticated posters alone, we could have sworn we were definitely going to love this one (at CinemaPointer, to avert prejudice, we avoid trailers). Unfortunately, 'Fantastic Numbers' turned out to be the polar opposite of its fantastic posters.",2
"Midnight Crew' is yet another repulsively ugly Nollywood comedy to avoid at the cinemas. All round appalling acting and a slew of ever more ludicrous scenarios ensure this is bound to be a total and complete waste of money for all who will dare. As a matter of fact, so unpleasant was the experience, that even people who got to see 'Midnight Crew' for free, hated it.",2
"Such a shame! Even the legendary Patience Ozokwor was only a marketing gimmick, fraudulently included for the benefit of posters and trailers- She appeared only at the very beginning, gave a monumentally half-assed performance and disappeared. Hopefully, legends such as Mrs Ozokwor will quickly come to realize that they owe a duty of care to we their fans, and thus shouldn't take their legendary status for granted; abusing it by hawking themselves to aid talentless filmmakers in swindling their fans out of their hard earned monies, in exchange for lucre.",2
Stale. Forced. Brash. Barely funny.,2
Ostentatious. Extravagant. And loud. Zero substance.,2

"The Milkmaid"" is undoubtedly an important film showing the tough situation against radical Islam the rural Nigerian population is faced with.

"The acting is at best wooden, the dialogue almost staccato, as if the actors are constantly being prompted with their lines. Ali Nuhu’s role felt almost like an afterthought. His acting has always been reserved; in this role, it is as if he does not want to be there, and it feels almost like a cameo.",2
"this is a story that has the potential for critical acclaim, but the execution is poor and makes it easily forgettable. ",2
"Transitions in the movie are haphazard and staccato: you are left wondering what the connection is between scenes.

It comes through with a weak plot, a scattered story line, and a watery script fill with contrived and deliberate comedy cast with unnecessary and unfunny comedic characters, who have nothing to add to the story. I am tempted to say that Suga Suga would have been better as a 40-minute comedy on television, but that would be unfair, as even TV is expected to live up to certain minimum standards.",2

It's a funny thing- It was billed to be spectacular, armed with the tongue lapping reverence of ""Kunle Afolayan"", but ends up the kind of movie you will finish with a hiss; like- ""Is that it? Mtchew!"" Ultimately 'Roti' doesn't know whether it wants to be horror or be a thriller. It starts cold. Get's warm. Bubbles a little. And then poof! Without warning, it evaporates.",2
"
'Alakada Reloaded' is a sham. It is preposterous. Utterly exasperating. Wholly ridiculous. And terribly disjointed. More a mixed bag of not-very-well-thought-out comic skits, than it is a full length movie with any purpose. Seeing old recycled jokes rehashed in the same old recycled way is not a pleasant experience at all. 'Alakada Reloaded' will almost make you puke. Sincerely, it's just outright shameful! Avoid it by all means.",2
"Segun Arinze’s role in the movie was confusing. He was a father, but he appeared more in a cameo than as a real role.

The transitions in the movie left a lot to be desired, and the resolution of the issues appeared half hearted. The movie tried to use suspense to depict some of the issues, but they were not properly executed.",2
"For a supernatural thriller cum action movie, Nneka the Pretty Serpent took too long to make it’s point. The long scenes dragged unneccesarily, the short scenes did not make the right impressions, and I struggled to keep my eyes open for the duration of the movie.  It eventually ended in an anticlimax that left a very weak cliff hanger. Perhaps the reboot of old movies needs  to make the scripts tighter without making the movie lose their essence.",2
"When we thought it was all over, the concluding scene brought even more confusion, which is saying a lot, as the movie had been confusing all along and I was sure it couldn’t get worse.",2

Nevertheless, we feel obligated to point out that, speaking to two out of the three other viewers we saw this with, they both described 'Getting Over Him' as being ""Nice"". And they might be correct.",2
"The worst part is that; for some uncanny reason, the producers chose to belabor their poor audience with unwieldy subtitles that disappear very quickly. Consequently, considering that whilst seeing 'Esohe', you will spend well over half the time reading these long unfriendly subtitles (languages other than English are extensively spoken), 'Esohe' becomes closer to arduous school work than it is entertaining.

"Absolute rubbish

I'm always on the hunt for a good Rom Com to watch with my wife. This had a review score over 6, so we gave it a crack. We literally stopped watching it after 10 minutes. Rubbish acting, like cringe worthy acting. I don't know who reviewed this with high scores in the past, but it's not worth the watch. The acting was just ""that bad"". Plus the story, as far as we watched was just terrible, b-grade stuff.",3
RHH Review,3
"One-way traffic plot, average movie at best.

Lionheart was a movie that generated a lot of buzz in the Nollywood industry. Considering the international support it got from Netflix, I was particularly excited to see how this movie went.

From the get go the movie wears an indigenous look with local scenery and an instant banter in local language.

However, it was one way traffic from there onwards, as the movie progressed.

The plot is totally bare and overly predictable, and I'm still reeling from the shock of this being a comedy film.

However, I still applaud the production quality of this film as it was great and a large chunk of the headline cast delivered on their script-save for Peter Okoye who was highly disappointing.

For a directorial debut, one can only applaud the courage of Genevieve in pulling off this movie.

On a final note, you are not guaranteed to have a good time watching this, and do not expect any fireworks.",3
"Wrote better stories at 6years

"My first Nigerian movie

For the past several years, I have come across a number of reports telling about how the country of Nigeria has a successful domestic film industry. While that fact definitely intrigued me, I was unable to find any Nigerian movies available for me to look at until I stumbled upon this one on Netflix. To be honest, I was expecting something pretty crudely made, and to a large degree this is true. While there are some pretty good composed shots and/or direction that indicate that at times some real effort was being made by the filmmakers, the movie has far more shortcomings. The cinematography is unimpressive, there's very little in the way of production values, and the acting by many of the performers is amateurish. Actually, I might have been able to forgive all that had the movie's biggest problem did not exist, that being that it's far too long (121 minutes in length) and far too slowly paced. This is a story that really needed to be cut down either at the script stage or when the footage was being edited. There is a twist towards the end that's a little interesting (despite my ability to somewhat predict it before it unfolded), but it's too little and too late to make it worth sitting through a story that's too long and too slow. Still, if you have heard of Nigerian cinema and are curious about experiencing a sample of it, I've just told you of one possible accessible choice.",3
"I'm sorry, I just didn't like it.

This film is a great example of some incredible archive footage ruined by a boring, mediocre and incoherent film in between.

Yes, I have read the book. I wasn't expecting a literal screen translation of the book, as the book covers a vast array of characters, but I did expect the essence of it to be retained.

It wasn't.

The film follows the lives of twin sisters Olanna (Thandie Newton) and Kainene (Akina Noni Rose) right after Nigeria gets its independence from the British and through to the Biafran war, as the Igbo people struggle to establish an independent republic. The film (similar to the book) tries to follow the lives of these 2 affluent young women, their relationships with men and with one another set against a significant historical event in Nigeria.

I went to watch this film specifically to support African Cinema and exited about a Nigerian Director making a film with a strong cast. I was bitterly disappointed with the lazy result.

Firstly the performances; Chiwetel Ejiofor is ever earnest in his role as Olanna's lover Odenigbo. He is OK, not offensive and gives a similar performance as he did in 12 years a slave. Thandie Newton is horrific. She has literally two expressions. I like to think its to do with the bad direction, someone should have told her she's over-acting .

The worst and best performance came from Odenigbo's Mother played by Onyeka Onwenu. What can I say. The best is that she was very entertaining, funny and a joy to watch. What made it the worst was that it belonged to a different film. A film I would have preferred to watch by the way. Her performance added a quality of a soap opera to the film. Anika had the strongest performance among them and deserves a mention for it. 

The film has two parts, the first comes across as a cheap soap opera and the second, a cheap action movie. Choices that were made baffled me. Scenes played out that were pointless and didn't add much to the plot, making the first half plod along longer than it should have. The second half was riddled with inconsistencies and poor editing. Characters were introduced just as quickly as they were killed off. I am not sure why it was important to illustrate on a map were everyone was, that added nothing.

But the biggest problem with the film is that it lacked a director, a proper director. There wasn't anyone keeping the actors believable, controlling the movement of the camera, having a coherent edit or keeping tabs on the horrendous sound score.

Unbelievably the producers also produced Constant Gardener and should have known better than this. How can you allow an inexperienced Director to helm such a significant film? It's arrogant and irresponsible.

I am African (yes, I know it's a continent), I applaud any one trying to make our stories for an audience outside of the continent but this effort was so poor that I had to write about it. We can do much better than this.",3
" Worst adaptation ever

I am currently studying the book for my literature program, so I thought I would watch the movie just to visualize things and unfortunately I wish I had not done that because now I cannot unsee it Olanna is described as a bit curvy, Kainene has a cold personality but opposite is the case in the film. Ugwu appears for a few seconds, as if he is some extra character, the Kano massacre was so vague ,the tragedies that took place were just summarized, instead the director made it all about Olanna and Kainene and their man problems. The movie lacks the depth that the novel holds and has ruined the novel's prestige,to be honest . We don't even get to see Ugwu's transition from a naive rural boy to an almost well groomed young man, now literate and able to write a novel.My advice, go buy the book and read it instead because the visuals you will have when reading are much better than this movie.",3

"Swallow addresses deep societal issues on a surface level

Swallow is a period piece that takes place in the 1980s and the movie ensures you know this. It addresses a lot of issues like misogyny, the Nigerian patriarchy, gangs and of course drugs. However, there were a plethora of issues with this film. For example, scenes dragged on for too long with zero impact that completely takes you out of the experience. Set pieces were non-existent, making the film seem like an exaggerated stage play. The acting was decent unfortunately the story didn't give much to work with. The biggest problem for swallow is that it tries to address all these societal issues without taking any of it to heart, which ultimately leads to a boring finale that does not stick with you much after the movie's ending. Not Kunle Afolayan's best. 3/10.",3
"Terrible Plot and Terrible acting

The 3 star is for the cinematography which was spectacular and also the use of different languages. The plot was terrible and the acting was meh. I don't understand the hype. Jimmy Jean Louis wig was also terrible. I had to endure throughout the movie because I wanted to see if it would get any better but it got worse. Also, the lead actress was as bland as white rice she didn't really have a personality. Please if you haven't seen this movie don't waste your time.",3
"Unnecessarily long
For me, This movie has a good story but it was unnecessarily long, had unnecessary scenes and it was slow. Plot holes and weak acting that appears so exaggerated. Boring, not gripping, baffling Unrealistic characters as well for a Nigerian setting. I had to keep checking if I've watched up to 45minutes. The plot holes were terrible nothing made me want to watch more",3
"Not worth your time

While the message of the movie is obviously important, it doesn't save the movie.

The plot is very predictable to the last minute and even that is better than the extremely bad acting.

Lines are forcibly and unnaturally delivered, while simultaneously being a very weird mix of wannabe hip lingo and unfitting obscure words and sayings. The only decent performance is by Jimmy Jean-Louis and even that is only decent at best.

The only reason this isn't rated lower is because the cinematography is actually rather gorgeous. Scenes, lighting and coloring is very a esthetically pleasing and on a technical level the movie is on par with some of the better movies.

In short, I have been far more entertained by garbage movies, Citation is just an unimaginative ensemble of scenes stitched together to something that can barely be called a movie.",3

This picture had the premise for a great story and started out okay before descending into the same rehashed 'Nollywood' stereotypes - lacking depth of character or some sort of logic to the plot. The story floats around aimlessly without any character really convincing you of their journey as they simply appear and dissipate from the film. The only redeeming quality of this film is the Genevive Nnaji's performance which was barely competent but not earth shattering. 

I really wanted 'The Mirror Boy' to be impressive and hoped the IMDb rating, which is usually a good yardstick, was warranted unfortunately this has turned out to be one of the rare exceptions when it is wide off the mark.",3

The story loosely makes sense and attempts to tug at your heart strings. Oh! look how these girls are abused by pimps and politicians. They want to escape, but even then there is a price to pay. But the execution is so sloppy, you wish the movie was no longer than a trailer. The ending is downright comical and not worth waiting until.",3
"Charming but incompetent

If this movie is meant to be truly reflective of policing in Nigeria - then that is a worry as all police officers in the film were, whilst loveable, extremely incompetent.

Much of the movies focus is on ceremonial pomp with very little credible detective work or focus. The plot twists were also as mundane and predictable and were only bested by the poor quality of dialogue.

If you are going to have an english movie - make sure all of the characters can speak english please. Otherwise keep it in its original dialect and simply have subtitles.

My favourite character was also the most incompetent - Sergeant Afonja. A very likeable buffoon - I am never sure if that is what the director is going for or if its by complete accident.

In any case - i doubt he could solve a robbery even if the burglar handed themselves in.

Watch it but only for the beautiful countryside and nice people starring in it.",3

Two hours and twenty minutes? If they had cut out all of the overly long staring and useless wandering, the movie would have been an hour, tops. I guess this is a revenge film? I could only make it through an hour before fast forwarding to the end.

There was zero emotion in this movie. People reacted so unnaturally. For instance, a girl spilled a drink and a man stood up and yelled, ""Are you blind?"" Then everyone stood around for a few awkward seconds. I don't know, maybe they were trying to remember their lines.

Nneka was so slow I actually checked to see if my wi-fi was working. This isn't a slow burn, it's a clogged toilet.",3

Not well researched storyline. It is absolutely disappointing that a movie based on legal cases was not well researched. How can a Senior Advocate of Nigeria not know that charges are not filed by the victim or the victim's relative in a criminal case? Culpable homicide, rape etc are offences against the state and not against the victims! The entire series could have been made better without the dry humor of overacting Stella(Anee Icha). Her acting, along with that of the document controller is below standard and I am surprised the director of the series did not see this! Overall, the series is unwatchable, below standard, loose storyline, dry over-theatrical comedy. I would not recommend this series.",3

I am not sure why is the number so high when most of the European countries are dealing with a percentage of 0.00008! Anyway, this disease and its effects were used for a screenplay and a story which was supposed to be some kind of a family drama... but it looked more of a soap opera episode with bad dialogues, awful acting and simply boring cinematography.

"Poor

I hate to write a bad review about what is apparently a genuine and authentic attempt to make a film. Some films are just so patently awful that skewering them is almost cathartic. This is not the case here. Rag Tag is about two friends, Rag and Tag, who come from different backgrounds, are separated as children and reunited as adults.

While it has a potentially interesting story and there are a few laughs and even a few sweet moments, these few and far between assets are lost amidst poor directing, filming, editing, acting and (at least in the showing I saw) bad sound. I went to this film on this site's high rating (an amazing 7.7, as of this writing), but it definitely wasn't worth my $10. Save your money and give it a pass.",3

Outside the confusion, judging from the little we could make of the story from the audio, 'The Perfect Picture' might actually have turned out good. Unfortunately we will never know that because the finished product turned out to be so bad that: In one scene we can see three people are talking, but all we can hear whilst seeing them talk is the cry of the lady coming from the next scene. However, by the time we do see her crying, we can't hear her cry any longer. Instead, we hear the dialogue of the coming scene.

Head Shaking Sad.",3

The acting was also quite good. The Problem with 'Zena' is that it is boring as hell. The story it tells is too basic to be remembered. Ultimately, 'Zena' proved too unappealing to stir any excitement in its audience. Put you to sleep, it will.",3

Ultimately, 'Makate Must Sell' offers no real value as it is just too obvious and too forceful to be truly funny.",3
" Papa Ajasco comes to cinema in this exceptionally ridiculous and ostentatiously foolish comedy.

Having no other purpose, than to massage the ego of its producers as filmmakers, 'Kasala' is a completely useless movie. A pain inducing potpourri of dire dullness and meaningless rubbish. We guarantee, without an iota of doubt; if you pay a premium to see this movie, you will regret it. And very dearly so. In fact, you will regret it, even if you see it for free. Only your enemies deserve tickets to see this. Don't pay for pain. Run!

"Great story....AWFUL acting

The story was really great. I really enjoyed it. The acting on the other hand was so bad, it was laughable. I also thought the camera was extremely unsteady, which just equates for poor editing. If they ever remake this film, which I do hope someone does do in the future, please choose your cast and crew more carefully next time. It is a pity to let such a beautiful story go to waste with such awful taker showcasing it.",3
"Good story spoiled by amateurs

This is a good story, but it's not a horror. Think of it as a horror comedy and it's possible you may enjoy it. If you can see beyond the awful acting. It's the sort of film a bunch of teenage girls could safely enjoy. No real scares, no gore, but I did enjoy the story.",3
"Started out decent then crashed and burned

Warning: Spoilers
The storyline though seen over and over, started out ok, then just took too long to keep it going, this movie didn't have to be this long, and after all the buildup, it ended with a dude, the mother of the daughter who was tormented simply took back control of the house thus all the haunting ended, huh?",3

"""They deported me from the USA""

Some things are universal, wherever you go you will find a film student producing a self-righteous movie about how difficult it is to produce movies, and Green White Green is the most typical example of this archetype.

The film features all of the hallmarks of a poorly produced student film: royalty-free music, unprofessional and generally very bad actors, some inspired visuals but generally poorly composed cinematography, dreadful editing, and a clear lack of confidence in their own creative vision that the film's narrative must be meta and ironic in some sense. If I wanted to see this calibre of filmmaking I would have attended the screening of films from production students at my own university, which I did not. The only distinction between this and the films that my peers produce is the slight novelty of this being a Nigerian production however that largely feels like a wasted opportunity. Themes of class and wealth are certainly discussed but are massively overlooked. For all the empty platitudes the film preaches about wealth inequality there are clear instances wherein the film exhibits its own prejudices towards impoverished people, be it the unfavourable light the rival group of lads are shown in because of their background, blatant xenophobia towards people of the impoverished nations (particularly other African nations and the middle east) and generally holding the West (particularly Northern Europe and the United States) to high regard. This is unsurprising from a director who was taught filmmaking at NYU (New York University). In interviews director Abba Makama speaks at length about how the film represents the different ethnic groups of Nigeria and puts homegrown, indigenous African artistry on a pedestal, when the film itself has such an overt occidental vision and hardly ever properly explores themes of race and poverty. As virtuous and important as he believes his film to be, Green White Green is just a dime a dozen not only in terms of its typical film student approach but also it being lost in a sea of Nollywood movies, a vast number of which more adequately explore themes of race and Nigerian nationality. Remove those themes and this is just as generic a movie that anyone with a couple years of formal education could produce.

And it comes with the territory of a student film that there might be some inspired elements. A clear admiration for the canon of film that came before it, some ambitious cinematography, a fairly decent script, again these things are not uncommon of a student film but aid in making Green White Green at least engaging to a certain extent.",3

"Citation is a hefty film, which may even prove too much for certain people, it handles a lot of serious issues which ultimately deserve a better effort behind the camera involving a more sensitive approach. 

The first notable flaw is the film’s length, it’s 2 and a half hours which proved tedious clarified by a number of scenes which added nothing to the narrative. The film has a lot of tonal issues, as previously mentioned the sheer heft of the film’s themes were not dealt with well or consistently, the expositional scenes feel like they were written for a TV soap and in contrast some of the flashbacks were clearly confounding in tone. The film is all over the place when it comes to narrative, they obviously couldn’t  figure out what way to tell the story and they visibly struggled to decide what to include in the film, a lot of non-relevant material is brought up. 

The performances are mostly fine, but the editing made it hard to follow any character for long enough to feel anything towards them other than fore-frontal empathy or hatred. The filmmaking is a definitive letdown, the sound mixing and editing stand out as particularly poor, it often sounds like they allowed children inside of the editing room and the dialogue scenes are often hard to hear due to bad mixing. The score is really bad, there’s a scene which is incredibly hard to watch but the score sounds like something used in a fight sequence, and it lessened the heftiness of the scene. 

It’s a film with so many obvious flaws that it’s hard to find positives, there isn’t many within the craft, but I have an admiration for what they were trying to do, unfortunately the people working on the production didn’t have the proficiency or competence to handle the deep thematic elements of the film and some of the filmmaking is quite simply terrible.

"Can't say this movie makes sense
Sure, the production value isn't good and you can tell in the first 15 minutes, but the story and writing just don't make sense
This movie isn't about a heist or what these guys actually do, it's like if someone made a movie just to be able to look at attractive girls and drive nice cars
There's a fine movie here somewhere, but the writer who I guess is also one if the main characters and is a popular Nigerian comedian needed to do better...but there were some funny scenes I guess

Watching this after the second one didn't explain anything except two really strange starts to relationships...all the second one did was introduce new characters in a way that made it seem I should watch the first one to have an idea of who they were.
This movie was just weird but I wil rewatch it soon to see if I will like it more...like the ending, so did he shoot his sister? Was it all a set up? I have no idea",3
The ending was the only enjoyable part of this for me. Good for her.,3
"“This bed is soft like fresh bread”

📝: A Nigerian musician and his fiancé go to Atlanta and then Jamaica with a couple - one of whom happens to be a criminal called ‘big man’.

😭: Why are they dressed in Bob Marley t-shirts before they land in Jamaica? When does the hair style on the supporting actress change multiple times back and forth? Why does the lead character speak in Yoruba to every Jamaican he meets? 

🥴: The screenplay is ridiculous - why are Jamaicans on the phone to random Nigerians at the behest of a stranger? What is the point of  that scene? 

🤣: The spliff segment was clearly written by someone who has never had, and knows no one who has ever had, a joint. It is a childish cartoon depiction of weed. 

🤔: This film is ridiculously over the top. The lines are delivered with melodrama and sledgehammer humour. That said because the movie falls apart on so many levels, (with even the sound editing compromised), it becomes morbidly fascinating.

“Welcome to Jamaica big man.” *Evil laugh*

The only thing that saved this was that I was really rooting for Ope and Deji. The acting was SO bad and the  writing was even worse. There were some elements thrown in there that added absolutely nothing to the story- like Chica’s obsession with Deji and that one celebrity girl who sang at the hotel. The last scene where Deji and Ope kiss and the stangers going for a walk stop to clap for them was SOOO cringe.,3
"I caught the Nollywood bug while watching Rattlesnake: The Ahanna Story, and decided to follow it up with another trending movie from the industry to recently hit Netflix. That's how we're here discussing 'Kambili: The Whole 30 Yards'

Rom-coms are sweet, sha, I almost never hold them to very high standards, because they're just for the laughs. And even though I never laughed at any scene in this movie, I kept watching with a long face, hoping to get excited at something. Well, that didnt happen either. This movie just came and went, with nothing happening to me... until the last few minutes. Everything that happened from when it was time for SPOILER and SPOILER to come together left me itching with mild irritatation at how not in tune I was with the entire movie, especially its endgame.

Oh, well, on to the next one.",3
"I knew nothing about Netflix's first acquisition of 2019 Lionheart when I started it but it turned out to be about a Nigerian bus company and it's financial troubles. The performances are pretty good for the most part and it looks decent. Nigeria is kind of a beautiful country and I don't think I've seen many films out of there if any.

The score to this was absolutely dreadful. During some of the more serious moments it has these upbeat steel drums or something and it completely took me out of it. This same track plays over like 70% of the film. The story didn't really do much for me and became extremely predictable and repetitive by the end. Not one I will remember later on in the year that's for sure.",3
"just so wanted this to work and the fact that this is a personal story is so moving and touching. But honestly there are very few choices visually, sonically, or performance wise that work at all.

Ugh. This isn’t the type of thing I want to hate.

"I hate how this movie is titled. It already implies a film full of sexist stereotypes of women, which it also turns out to be. However looking at it from another perspective it's interessting that the role men play in this movie is rather passive and their characters don't develop (neither do the female roles really). The acting, editing and camera is terrible and I hate that I wanna see the second part of this awful movie so desperatly😅.",3
" 'Clustered Colours' is like cheap doughnut with plenty of nothing around a very tiny something. Unfortunately that ""tiny something"" is too tiny to be worth paying a premium to see. Maybe even too tiny to be regarded as a movie. At its heart, 'Clustered Colours' is essentially a very-short ""play"" speaking on challenges of marriage, importance of forgiveness and paramountcy of Love. Now, that is all good. The problem rises because that entire ""play"" is only twenty minutes long, yet 'Clustered Colours' runs a total of ninety minutes. What happened to the ""extra"" seventy minutes? Well",3
" As ridiculous and as unimaginative as its title is, very little separates 'Makate Must Sell' from Papa Ajasco's 'Knock Out'. This home video is essentially an amateurish concoction of very shallow Instagram skits; jumbled and gummed together by a stupendously banal copy-catty story we are sure you've probably seen many times before. Ultimately, 'Makate Must Sell' offers no real value as it is just too obvious and too forceful to be truly funny.",3
"This movie is ugly. ""Ugly"" must be the word. '1929' is an eyesore. Featuring some of the worst and shabbiest costumes, props and appurtenances to ever come out of Nollywood, '1929' is utterly and extremely displeasing to look at. Goodness gracious! 'Igodo: The Land of the Living Dead' all the way back from 1999 featured way, way better costumes and props. As a matter of fact, even the old school re-enactments of 'Tales by Moonlight' from 1984 were light years better.",3
"Ultimately, murdered by severe cases of over-acting and wanton fake-ness, 'Hire a Woman' is a sterile movie that lacks any real magic. Its highlight are beautiful women and handsome men, unfortunately this lot can't act to save their own lives.

"Such a shame really; 'The Island' is a waste of amazing talent, quality movie-props and a substantial production budget.

It promised laughter, but the comedy was minimal and elicited smiles rather than the hearty laughter you expect when you go to the cinema for a comedy.

"I haven't read Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Orange Prize-winning novel, though I am aware of the consensus that it is, to quote Harold Bloom, reet good an' all. It's been called the African Gone With the Wind, and considering the racial politics of the American Gone With the Wind that's a necessary corrective. The main frustration of this film adaptation is that it's not hard at all to see the good in it, but it's just so fitful and haphazardly realised.

The first problem is that it's telling a story which seems to me to be more suitable for a miniseries, or at least a Christopher Nolan-length film, at just under an hour and fifty minutes. The compression makes it harder to care about the stories - why should we invest in the marriage of two characters when we've gone from them meeting to him cheating on her in about fifteen or twenty minutes? It also creates some moments of bathos, for example, when joyous newsreel showing the creation of the independent nation of Biafra cuts immediately into Anika Noni Rose gloomily declaring that there'll be a war soon. Not that there's no possible character reason why she wouldn't feel as happy as the people in the archive footage - but the suddenness!

That newsreel was also a big problem for me. Half of a Yellow Sun has as its background the attempt by the southern region of Nigeria to become an independent nation, and the vicious civil war that ensued. It's a story that needs to be told if we're to understand the aftermath of colonialism on African nations - but it's also one that few Westerners know. Writer and director Biyi Bandele fills in the background with newsreel footage and a narrator doing his best old-fashioned BBC presenter voice. I felt there was an opportunity missed here to ironize that dynamic, to create a stronger counterpoint between how this war was reported by the European former colonial powers and what it was like to live through it.

As it stands, the most immediate and hard-hitting thing in Half of a Yellow Sun is Thandie Newton's lead performance, one of the rare moments when this actress has been given something worthy of her talent and charisma. Her wrenchingly performed anguish ties the emotional and political stories together even as Bandele struggles to. Made exclusively within the Nigerian film industry at the urging of Adichie, Half of a Yellow Sun is a film of impeccable good intentions and good taste at the expense of anger, sweep and passion. It's watchable and enjoyable - but maybe it shouldn't be.

"Thank God I read the book.

I have consumed nearly all of Ms Adichie. While I was 'Literature in English' subject teacher in 2012, 'Purple Hibiscus' and 'Half of A Yellow Sun' were in the prescribed literary texts list. Thus, in 2012, my students and I ate Half of A Yellow Sun, even every word and punctuation. Fast forward to 2014 when we geared for the Nigerian release of the movie adaptation, hopes were dashed however when the movie received a tentative ban from the government who feared that it (Half of A Yellow Sun Movie) might incite violence and start a second civil war. ""Ok, this movie must be the s**t"" but no it wasn't.

You can only only imagine how weak and watery the movie script was. But wait, you don't need to imagine, the movie shows it all. I tortured my brain to see the movie 'til the end, and that was because I had read the book. What about people who hadn't read that fine novel? They were served trash. I know a film adaptation cannot do justice to a book of almost 500 pages but Biyi Bandele could have avoided the pitfalls. I'm sure he was awestruck by the novel that he felt he owed CNA a duty to copy and paste everything from the novel into the film ( but he should have been warned). Better still he should have used a 'based upon' approach rather than this verbatim adaptation, and we still would be OK.

Getting to the nucleus of what a book is truly about is the cue to an adaptation. I'm not sure Biyi knew that. Maybe now he knows that some scenes were not needed in the movie. However, thank God I read the book.",4
"awful rendition of a very good novel

the only redeeming features of this film are that the use of colour is beautiful in places and there are a few good Nigerian character actors who give some engaging performances. 

But oh my goodness if you've read the novel you will be stunned at how badly it has been brought to the screen. I noticed in the opening credits that Aidichie the author did not write the screenplay and it shows.

The acting is, by and large unconvincing, but what really weakens the novel is the very simplistic way that the complexities of the Biafran crisis are presented to the viewer. There's almost no way for someone with no background of the events concerned to make any sense of it all. And the film almost ignores the horrific atrocities, the atrocious famine and the way that the crisis was made worse by almost the entire political world turning a blind eye for four long years.

The editing is woeful with the plot taking place in several locations interspersed with archive BBC news footage. The scenes are all confined to static sets with few exceptions. Those exceptions are badly filmed 'action' shots with 1980s A-Team special effects. 

Oh, and then it ended. Just like that.

Very very disappointing. Don't waste money on this at the cinema. Spend it instead on the excellent novel which I fear many will now not read because they think it will be as bad as the film.",4

"In the style of a 1985 soap opera
Has the look and feel of a soap opera from 1985 except with fewer twists, less campiness, no surprises, less suspense and a very long, drawn out plot.

On the plus side, the acting is really good and all the actors seemed believable in their characters. Plus, I love the fact that the creators didn't take themselves too seriously, adding humor throughout, especially in the first half. To me the plot isn't dark enough or gory enough to be horror, it's more like family drama with some wannabe horror moments touching on faux-occult.

The camerawork and musical score are good, but nowadays that's table stakes for most movies, and not something to brag about.

The biggest drawback is that, at two hours, this movie could have been edited down more efficiently to about an hour. Considering there are zero surprises, and the plot is predictable, turning this into two hours literally ruins the movie. Had it been much shorter it would have been far more interesting and the same story could have been told.",4

STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

In the 1960s and 70s, poor Nigerian families would loan their children to British couples while they went away to try and attain a better life. Ingrid (Kate Beckinsale) and her husband are one such couple, taking in Enitan (Damson Idris), from Femi (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and his wife, who struggles to blend in. As a young man in the early 1980s, he has difficulty coming to terms with his own identity, and after a run in with Levi (John Dagleish) and his gang of skinheads, descends into a downward spiral of destruction that threatens to rip everything apart.

With the rise of racist ideology rising back up in society at the moment, what could now be seen as a period piece in the shape of the early 1980s, serves as a fitting template to set a story, at a time when it was a lot more blatant and uncensored. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, a rising star after last year's Dark Money (despite having an unpronounceable name!), here showcases his writing and directing debut, as well as providing an integral supporting role, in a tale he probably had some first hand experience of.

It's a startling practice, that I like probably many others, wasn't aware went on, and it certainly provides riveting potential for some powerful drama. Lead star Idris has an effective presence, and delivers a strong performance, with some reliable, sturdy support from the likes of Beckinsale, Dagleish, and of course Agbaje himself. And there's some suitably unsettling depictions of racist violence that get under your skin. Sadly, it's all executed in a completely uninvolving and ineffective manner, never getting you to feel for any of these characters, or flesh them out in any meaningful way.

Agbaje obviously has a passion for film, and depicting accounts of racial aggravation/tension in his adopted home. Hopefully, this is just a little blip on the path to something greater. **",4
"There Was An Interesting Story Here - This Isn't It

In the early 1990s while dinning in an African restaurant in Los Angeles, I bumped into Adewale - he'd heard my English accent as I spoke with my West African wife and struck up a conversation. We exchanged numbers and agreed to meet up again having mentioned our mutual interest in the movie industry. He was just breaking into Hollywood and I fancied myself a screenwriter. Adewale shared the phenomenon of 'farming the children,' recounting his own experiences under that abdication of parental responsibility. Since we're both Londoners of similar age we shared stories of our youth in the late seventies. I spent that period of my life deeply immersed in the British punk rock scene, itself a hub for the skinhead and mod revivals. I have no recollection of Adewale mentioning his peculiar involvement in a gang of ultra-violent white racist skinheads during this era; perhaps shame dictated he avoid speaking of such an astonishing episode in his life.What I do know is that his movie's portrayal of nineteen-seventies white working-class English people and of the subcultures of their children is absurdly cartoonish and trite. The neo-Nazi, psycho-skin trope has been a reliable contemporary Hammer Horror-like monster which 'Farmed' disappointingly enjoins. It's unfortunate since this era's youth is redolent with story lines worth telling - and worth telling accurately. The working-class English who lived during that time are a kaleidoscope of characters and attitudes worthy of honest examination as are their interactions with immigrants and their English-born children. To portray them as generally bigoted, oafish, humourless and hyper-aggressive is to indulge a stereotype no less insulting than the black pimp or the inscrutable Asian. Nigerian farmed children have unique and lamentable stories, but for me this film failed to capture the emotional complexity and profundity of the arrangement due to heavy-handed poetic license of the writer/director.",4
"A Hollywood Deception

Wally Badger, aka Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, is misleading his intended audience with a view to making a profit. Unbeknown to him, because he failed to do proper research, the Skinhead gang he claims to of belonged to, have been written about many times online and in print. The BBC even recorded a documentary detailing some of their activities. The evidence that suggests his story is pure fantasy, will be damaging to him to say the least.",4
"Had so much potential be better

There was a real story there but wasn't written/executed as well as it could have. Pacing felt rushed. Viewer couldn't connect/sympathise with characters.",4
"Impressive but not so Captivating nor Thrilling

2010's much talked about movie Ijé: The Journey was released on DVD a few days ago so i decided to check it out and see what the hype was all about- You're about to read my review. Nigerian movies have come a long way from the ""microwave era"" when movies were made within a 1wk or so (not that it's not still happening) and Ijé is proof that something good can come out of a well put together script.

Ijé: The Journey stars two of Nigeria's heavy weights in the movie industry Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde and Genevieve Nnaji as the lead characters and it co-stars a number of foreign actors who managed to spice up the movie.

The movie tells the story of two sisters Anya (Omotola Jalade- Ekeinde) and Chioma (Genevieve Nnaji) who have an unbreakable bond of loyalty and the power of the human spirit which ultimately gets tested over the course of the movie.

When Anya, the eldest of the two, vows to chase her dreams of glamour in the Hollywood Hills, her younger sister, Chioma—warns her of the dark side of the American Dream. Now, years later, and in a world away from the life she knew, Anya is charged with the murder of three men, one of them her powerful husband. Chioma travels to her sister's side to battle not only a flawed justice system with the aid of a young and disillusioned attorney, but the very notion of ""truth"" as the cultural values of two worlds collide.

Samuel Tilsen and Chineze Anyaene who are credited as the writers of this movie could have did a good job mashing different elements of drama flicks centered around a murder and trial while. The movie could have been 20mins or more shorter if a number of scenes had not be stretched or had been completely omitted but at the end of the day it all came down to what Chineze Anyaene the director wanted.

There were times when watching the movie was a lot like watching one of those Televista series like ""When You Were Mine"" which i don't say in a good way and the sound in the background was little too much as i would have preferred if not every scene had some sort of music playing in the background and thus give the pictures life of their own. Still on music, Asa crooning her hit track ""Awe"" as the opening soundtrack was alright initially but then it started dragging on and was used a second time in the movie (i hope she got paid) making it tiring.

For my second Nigerian movie in 2012, it sure was better than Mr and Mrs (Joseph Benjamin & Nse Ikpe Etim) where they kept zooming in on the actors and objects in the room in almost all the scenes making you wonder if you were watching an interview put together by an amateur instead of a movie expected to be enjoyed. The scenes in Ijé flowed properly and for someone not looking to analyze every single scene it came out commendable.

I decided to go in on the actors in the movie as the last part of my review as i was expecting more from the ""Nollywood Heavyweights"" Omotola & Genevieve but instead their acting wasn't so impressive but worth praising when compared to Ulrich Que's acting in the movie. Ulrich played the lawyer (Jalen Turner) in the movie and i have to say his acting was laughable (hopefully they didn't pay him much for the movie). Not all the actors were unconvincing in their roles and one of those that managed to deliver was the inmate ""Libby"" played by Diana Yekinni.

While Ijé: The Journey (with a budget of about $2.5 million) isn't your everyday Nollywood film and had a good story-line, i certainly won't be watching this one a second time as the movie wasn't captivating nor was it thrilling and i could easily leave my seat with the movie playing and not ask ""What did i miss?"" the moment i returned.",4
"
A grimly interesting story that is sadly reduced to a cliched, tedious movie.",4
"The historical context is more intriguing than the specifics of this harrowing and provocative story, which lacks sufficient character depth and narrative texture.",4
"Dishearteningly, Enitan's transition from lost soul to a scholar and now an artist gets shoved into the final minutes left over after all the bleakness. Akinnuoye-Agbaje's admirable life story gets reduced to its most sensational chapter.",4
"Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who writes, directs and experienced such 'farming' first-hand, delivers a searing account of the racism these youngsters encountered, before getting horribly bogged down in an over-extended skinhead drama…",4
"The writer and director, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, is drawing on his life here, and his account of the hero's agonies is commendably intense, but its lack of subtlety blunts the film's force.",4
Enitan's trauma is revelled in but for what? Few new truths are learned here.,4
"[Adewale] Akinnuoye-Agbaje's slightly numbed screenplay never gets to grips with who Eni is, resorting instead to using other characters' observations to define him.",4
"Though the central performance is impressively raw Farming's uncompromising bleakness drowns out the fascinating story, making it a far tougher watch than it needs to be.",4
A visceral exploration of identity and tribalism. Farming is emotionally powerful; a well made and unflinching look at the people who are lost in the madness of crowds.,4
"
Equally powerful and uncomfortable, Farming is a stark reminder of the dangerous lengths that self-loathing can lead to.",4
"It's a hell of a story, but left me feeling that Akinnuoye-Agbaje - who also appears as his own father, and performs roughly half of the songs on the soundtrack - was perhaps too close to the subject to tell it with the clarity it demands.",4
"Another good potential ruined by bad writing

If you don't have a good script to start with, don't make the movie.

This is a historic drama. As one watches, the potential for the story is there. Some people will claim this has bad acting, but remember where this is filmed and don't expect Hollywood mannerisms from that part of the world. The acting is true to that culture.

The writing and story though... that was pretty poor, as was the directing and choreography. Fake fighting, punches being visibly pulled, swords slowly and barely connecting, the ""sword to the side"" trope, etc. Not that I care to see realistic battles, but there are non-gory ways to present battles that aren't obviously fake.

Some of the story is presented well. The pain and suffering of slavery. The subterfuge of betrayals. But surprisingly, the main character herself is about as two-dimensional as they come. The King was a more interesting presentation. It seems a great deal was left out of the story, but it's hard to tell what since I haven't studied that part of history. Basically, the story just falls flat with a really lazy ending.

I'm being generous in giving it 4 stars... and I do that mainly because of the unusual setting and the fact that it was moderately interesting all the way through. But when it comes to the end of the movie one realizes what a let-down the whole thing is. As far as a cinematic presentation and presentable story line goes, this fails to deliver.",4
"A good story ruined by a bad screenplay

This is a weird one. I can tell that it's a good story with several intrigues, but most of the scenes were terrible, and the fighting scenes in particular. The acting goes from stage actors to ""I tried my best as an amateur"".

What's surprising is the quality of the photo. Really sharp images with great color grading, and I can say the same thing about the score. I can tell that there is some budget behind the movie, with the costumes and all - the movie even got some descent enough CGI.

If a capable person would had gotten their hands on the script, and written a good screenplay, this would actually be something I would recommend to people. If a great screen play, then this would be a must watch. I had to watch the movie with the notion of what it could have been; with dreamy sequences, dramatic closeups, and voice overs telling thoughts over the scenery playing out in front of my eyes.

If you crave for a Nigerian fantasy flick, with inspiration from real events(?), then watch this one. Otherwise, just watch some Nollywood movie instead. At least you will have a laugh.",4
"Can a movie be bad, but important?

Ok, this movie wasn't a ""great."" There was a low budget feel, the acting and script were mediocre. Yet, interracial and intercultural romances, especially with non-European leads, need to be told. So, there wasn't a great love story here... you didn't fall in love with the characters because they were shallow; there were definite plot flaws (like why a character would take a certain opportunity offered at the end of the movie when it didn't correspond with previously stated goals and ideals.) The dancing was incredibly poor (serious actors take classes and study the art form to look at least passably convincing or hire a body double). But at least someone represented an intercultural love story, perhaps opened the way for discussion, understanding, curiosity, interest, between people of different backgrounds. So, I support this movie... and I'll forget about it entirely in a few days and never think of it again.",4
"Production and soundtrack ruined a good story

The story was interesting, the acting good, and the end provided sufficient closure. However, the production was awful. The picture needed to be clearer and the sound much better. At time I couldn't hear it well enough, but turning it up meant causing it to sound like screeching. All of these production problems seem to be common for Nigerian movies. The soundtrack ... definite overuse of the music (another common fault with Nigerian films), and too many long shots of nothing. For example, the camera focusing on feet walking ... at most, this should only be for a few seconds. But again, a common problem with these films. I would happily buy this movie (instead of just borrowing) if the production were more professional. No/low budget is no excuse. Technical training must be done to give these stories their due. Blood Sisters (1 & 2) was well written. Pretty much all of the dialogue was meaningful too. I mean, not a lot of wasteful or redundant words. I've seen quite a few Nigerian films, and this one is the best so far. It *moved* me. it also contained all the good elements that make a good, entertaining story. I'd give it a 10 if it weren't for the production problems and waste of film on useful footage (a car driving, a person walking, etc. ... Just too much time spent on these shots).",4
"Slow Drama

Mother of George begins with a traditional African wedding ceremony which takes place in New York City. The bride and groom are toasted with wishes for a baby boy in the near future which will be named George, in accordance with the groom's mother's wishes. After a prolonged period, the hopeful mother to be does not conceive and she attempts various methods to become pregnant. After more time passes, she visits a fertility specialist, but her husband refuses to be checked out by American doctors. Her mother in law tells her that she should allow her husband a mistress in order to have a child. This idea does not go well, nor the next one of having his brother try to father a baby with her. The movie moves slowly, and while the acting is solid throughout, and the clothing beautiful, I was bored by the time it finished.",4
"Up set
Sometimes you have to endulge or at least overlook flaws to enjoy a movie. When it is one, that is supposed to be clever and keep us guessing to where it goes (with twists and so forth), you may be more easily annoyed if it isn't coherent though, which makes perfect sense (in contrast to the movie and how certain characters act and react).

Give it a break or not. It will be a deciding factor on how you'll view the movie overall. I've seen worse but also far better movies",4
"The Set Up for flashbacks

The main reason for me watching this film was Adesua Etomi-Wellington, I've watched a few of her movies and have enjoyed them, she is (IMO) very beautiful, and a good actress, so I hoping for another enjoyable film featuring her, this movie didn't deliver on that premise, flashback after flashback, left the movie very disjointed, and gave no reason to care for any particular character, looking at Adesua was the only reason I hung around, however big UP to Netflix for featuring International films, there are really good Nigerian films to watch.",4
"Good movie, way too long. Storytelling also needs pace.

Just saw Mother of George at Sundance. Movie tells a good story, spiced with ethnical flavor, colorful dresses and way too many close ups. The actors are very good, especially Yaya Alafia. She conveys the naivety of the character and her tortuous decisions. I think that the storytelling needed some faster pace. Many side tales shown in excruciating detail detract from the main thrust. The cinematographer has overdone the close ups and fade aways out of focus. And what is it with starting scenes focusing away from the action (a foot here, a finger there) and letting the audience guess what is going on from noise alone? The best scene, when Ayodele learns the truth about his son, is one time when fading of view and sound are truly effective. Many of the other seem contrived",4

"LACKED INDEPTH
teamo-797268 October 2020
LACKED INDEPTH 4/10: except this movie was based exactly on a true-life story, if no? here's my take: The movie is a typical cliche Nigerian movie. 'the characters/roles were projected with shallowness' Ehi, an undercover prostitute, seems to 'chicken out' when it's time to act her role but after the incident with sir Philips, she carried her two legs to go to Europe in a space of weeks. Really? When they just needed to burst the trafficker's activity. The movie is a kind that should give insight, spark discussions, give lessons on how to handle oneself in life/critical situations ;but just like many Nigerian movies...nothing really like that, for instance - after the situation with sir Philips and Ehi went to the hospital, they should have been able to get semen sample from ehi to indict/prosecute sir Philips ,they can even include that she lost the case or she went to women affairs and the case was taken up, but there was nothing like that , typical Nigerian movie(they don't teach people sense). The character building was poor, so no emotional attachment. This movie should be a sensitive one that should put people on edge for solid 120mins if they've put it together well enough but it's was just another 'Eeyah movie' (it's a pity) So there was not one single police dept/officer they (journalist) could work with? From the entire NPF in Lagos? In 2020? Really? So no other security agency - private/local/traditional in Lagos? Just the way nollywood won't consult with doctors while writing a script, its likely they didn't consult with the police/security Dept. Nigeria movie will show a Doctor tell a patient that their heart ,kidneys ,liver are failing and the person even need kidney transplant and that same patient/person would have the strength to jump up and be shouting 'Ewo' ,like really? Someone's systems are shutting down and the person still have so much strength. So as a journalist he couldn't even influence the NPF in 2020. That means the rest of the populace is DOOMED. So according to the movie Ehi was a novice, doesn't mean the person she was working with was too. So, her boss placed her in that type of situation without an emergency escape plan? it's like they don't even understand the in-depth of prostitution and human trafficking. Nollywood should stop feeding us breast milk instead of party jollof with moi-moi and nkwobi to step down. The rescue attempt was poor, the regular police coming at the last minute that Nollywood has been feeding us for ages, no gun battle . imagine a gun battle with the traffickers and still losing the girls or some of them. No attempt in communicating with the border in 2020? Really? I wasn't expecting a happy ending; ending was ok. 'So much to deliver yet they just blew the dust and a fair attempt to scratch the surface' . Movies should be able to balance, what is, what's not and what ought to be. Thanks.",4

"God Bless, I am Prince Goronyo Baba of Nigeria with 30 Million Dollars...
...sums up the current two 10/10 reviews.

This is African amateur writer, director and editor Akinyemi Sebastian Akinropo's first ever dabble in filmmaking, and it really does show.

The ""based on a true story"" is a very good and interesting story that needed to be told, but the execution of the storytelling was awful. It's started fairly decent, but Akinropo's editing was horrible with scenes dropping in out of nowhere and cutting out too soon. I call it ""blender editing"".

The pacing was fairly decent for the length of the screenplay, but the 100 min runtime was too long for the story being told. There were tons of plot and technical issues and many irregularities with the fluidity of the screenplay. This could have easily, and should have been, trimmed down to 80-85 mins tops.

The directing wasn't that bad for a first-timer, although some scenes were really badly directed and filmed that seemed 1980's dad-on-the-camcorder quality. The acting was actually not bad at all - for amateur actors that also had no direction from Akinropo. The sound was bad, probably from the lack of boom mics. The score and cinematography were adequate and the set location and landscape was great.

Filmmakers have to start somewhere, right, but I wish Akinropo had at least ran his script by a seasoned writer for some edits, and/or and experienced editor. That could've made this film much better. You can basically fast-fwd some scenes and not miss a thing. The true story needed to be told, and I'm glad it was, but wish it was told better.",4

This movie based on the ebola outbreak in Nigeria was very depressing and it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. In fact, it wasn't what I was expecting either. I thought that this was going to be about doctors fighting for a cure for their patients, but instead it was the doctors and nurses fighting for their lives.

"Well intentioned but amateurish attempt to move the viewer, while failing to recognize that the subject matter (a man's conversion from slaver to emancipator) itself is plenty dramatic -- just tell the story, straight, no chaser! The acting is wooden, the camera set-ups are uninspired and TV-like, and the costume and set design fairly shout ""Student film!"" Everything is too clean, the native women wear modest tops in an ecuatorial climate, and everyone looks like they just stepped out of the make-up trailer in Burbank. And the notion that the song ""Amazing Grace"" itself is a cribbing of an African melody is a flat falsehood. The instantly recognizable melody is from the 1835 song, ""New Britain,"" though the lyrics predated it by over 50 years. The way the filmmakers attempt to connect the melody to African folk music is cynical and manipulative. A great story always moves the audience. Newton's real story is far more compelling than the one told in this film. It has all the required elements of a great motion picture, but the filmmakers -- obviously spiritual amateurs themselves -- did not understand or trust the Spirit when they made this film. If they were sincere, five stars for trying. If not, zero. But the film itself? Two stars for a botched effort with no excuse available in the source material.",4

Even then, it appeared the film didn't bring the best out of him, or even the rest of the cast. I'm giving 2 stars because of the production quality which is beginning to improve generally with Nigerian films, the collaboration between 2 major ethnic groups, and the attempt to dispel the myth that all members of a particular ethnic group are dodgy.

"While the producers of 'The Herbert Macaulay Affair' must get an ""A"" for effort, especially in terms of setting, costumes and props, they earned themselves a Mighty Big ""F"" for failing to create the Magic, the flutter and the spark great movies create in the hearts and minds of their audience.

Instead, the producers serve us a cold turkey. No sauce. No salt. Crippled by mechanical transitions, robotic acting, terrible lack of chemistry and flimsy story telling, 'The Herbert Macaulay Affair' looks good but is very hard to eat. Worst part is; the desperately annoying music that plays continuously throughout, making dialogue hard-to-hear and in many cases downright inaudible.",4
"Not recommended. Some movies are made to win awards and thrill their producers. Some movies are made to excite and please their audience. If you know that you are not in the business of ""awarding"" awards to movies, you have absolutely no business 'Farming'. Attempt to do so, and you will harvest loads of pain and regret. This movie is excruciatingly boring!

The acting is great. No doubt. The production is pristine. No doubt. But all that aside; 'Farming' is a total and complete waste of money. Forget the hype. This is just another dark British movie that makes for a solemn and laborious watch. It was not made for Nigerians. Run!",4
"Alubarika' isn't terrible as far as acting and production goes; at two and a half hours long, it makes for a frustrating cinema experience - especially if you are not a sucker for Yoruba movies by nature.

"Maybe the best thing about this is that it's at least entertaining enough that you won't tear your hair out if you happen to see it. However, you will know very quickly that you've paid way more than it's worth. Because by rights, 'Father of Today' ought to be available for free on YouTube. Not showing in cinema.",4
"Once Upon A Night' is a dud. The audience didn't like it. And neither did we. Some would try excusing it, claiming it is too complicated and too masterfully storied for the ""ordinary"" viewer- Mere propaganda. Bottom line: As a movie, 'Once Upon A Night' is dastardly boring. And as horror it fails woefully.",4
"Unfortunately, we can't bear cowboy pistols, space guns, cut & sow costumes, annoyingly talentless filming and unnecessary long form remembrance ceremonies for already shown footage all buttered up with ridiculously unintelligent revelations of supposed-to-be shockers that were apparent from the beginning.

"If somehow, you can imagine sitting through a Nollywood attempt at a live-action re-imagination of some of Disney's greatest animated musicals; that nightmare you will see is what we suffered painfully through today seeing 'The Ten Virgins'. Terribly revolting, 'The Ten Virgins' is guaranteed to make your skin crawl and your tummy turn.  If you know anyone deserving of your punishment, just buy them a ticket.",4
"There's too little value here to be worth paying premium for. 'Thank God I Am Funny' comes in two parts. The first part runs for approximately ten minutes. In it, you get to watch Falz and company attempting to help SLK with haphazard and lackluster performances in successive skits, with their faces screaming: ""I don't want to be here!"". Consequently, they aren't half as funny as they are in skits offered on their own Instagram pages.

Part two is a gory tale of misfiring. For approximately an hour and twenty minutes, SLK will fight desperately to make you laugh, in a stand up session that feels like something in-between putting up with a talkative you don't like and listening to a friend trying to uplift your mood in a moment of sadness. Sandwiched by a desert of dead sticks, too few of the jokes offered are genuinely funny.

The producers brazenly attempt to cover-up these failures by heavily buffering the ""movie"" with elongated clips of an animated audience watching the live show. In reaction to the over dramatization, you will often find your nose sending out ""yinmu"" emojis involuntarily. Because, for all that this is, the incoming N200 DVD is your safest option. If you risk paying more; you won't leave happy.",4
" If we say 'Rant Queens' is stupid, we wouldn't be telling you the whole story. 'Rant Queens' is reckless with stupidity. It is yet another sad example of Iweka road and Ebinpejo lane ""stylishly"" invading cinemas with health hazards like 'Rant Queens', hellbent on bringing Nollywood into final disrepute and ghastly opprobrium. If you enjoy self mutilation, you may go ahead and see it. But we strongly, strongly, strongly suggest you avoid this pile of rubbish: Production. Rubbish! Acting. Rubbish! Story. Twice as useless!",4

It will help with your hissing as you are served copied scenario after copied scenario, many shamelessly stolen from other recent Nollywood movies. Disappointing. Blah!!",4
"Clustered Colours' is like cheap doughnut with plenty of nothing around a very tiny something. Unfortunately that ""tiny something"" is too tiny to be worth paying a premium to see. Maybe even too tiny to be regarded as a movie. At its heart, 'Clustered Colours' is essentially a very-short ""play"" speaking on challenges of marriage, importance of forgiveness and paramountcy of Love. Now, that is all good. The problem rises because that entire ""play"" is only twenty minutes long, yet 'Clustered Colours' runs a total of ninety minutes. What happened to the ""extra"" seventy minutes? Well...",4
"Fifty minutes is spent advertising a holiday resort in Lagos, which stars as both ""the real"" subject matter of 'Clustered Colours' and the movie-location. The producers will call it ""character development"". We call it a kidnap- Held hostage for fifty odd minutes, we were forced on an excursion of the resort grounds, making stops at the tennis court, the football pitch, the gym and swimming pool area that have nothing to do with the movie. After which the short ""play"" occurs. Then we spend the last twenty minutes watching the actors dance to music by Tosin Martins and other artistes. That's it! Movie closes. Money down the drain. Not recommended.",4
" A lot of work and ambition went into making 'Heaven's Hell'. But in the end, despite all the work. And all the ambition. 'Heaven's Hell' just isn't interesting. If you choose to see it, you will find there's more Hell waiting for you than Heaven. This movie itself is An Actor- The best thing it has going for it; is its ability to pretend. From its trailer to deep into its beginning, 'Heaven's Hell' proves extremely adept at pretending to be exciting or will be exciting. When in actual fact, it is numbing and drab. You will leave the cinema with a stinging feeling of: ""What did I just watch? One Five entered fire!""

We really wanted to like this. But it is plagued with so many problems, it is too stubborn to be likable. A pretender to the core, 'Heaven's Hell' is Un-Nigerian and Fake. It wants so much to be like the 'Tinsel' series but in actual fact it is a classless thug. The words ""F*ck"" and ""F*cking"" being its undoing, 'Heaven's Hell' could well be described as Tinsel's bastard half-brother. Blindly desperate for attention and notoriety, it unnecessarily uses ""F*ck"" and ""F*cking"" more than forty different times. Everything here is ""F this"" and ""F that"". When they are fighting; it is F! F! F! And even when they are loving; it is still F! F! F! One begins to wonder if the script was written by Tupac. Beyond that is an absolute lack of chemistry between actors. All good actors, with individually good performances. As a collective however, they don't gel at all. One actor's delivery to the next feels so mechanical, reminding us of that famed party game: ""Musical Statues"". And it doesn't help that the entire movie is subtitled in English, even though actors are speaking English. And these subtitles are tattered; drowned in errors and shredded by typos. To add insult to injury; like a pirated-Chinese copy, many times the subtitles don't sync with actual dialogue. There are myriad of issues with 'Heaven's Hell', but we will stop our recount here so we may yet sleep in peace.

Note to Nollywood: Subtitles in cinema kill suspense. Especially when not done correctly. In 'Heaven's Hell' as it was in 2018's 'Esohe', several lines of dialogue appear on screen before being spoken. Consequently, the pause effect of their delivery on the audience is lost as we can already see, four or five words forward, what actors are going to say next. Without surprise, dialogue is impotent.",4
"Night Bus to Lagos' is ""One-Chance"" waiting to happen. Despite being produced by Zeb Ejiro and directed by Chico Ejiro, two Nollywood Goliaths, this 'Night Bus to Lagos' fails to arrive safely. Taking a ride on this derelict contortion characterized by old school film-making techniques, was a terribly discomforting experience for us. Making it seem like; their glory days behind them, ""our fathers"" failed to spend the passing years learning and improving. Consequently, their swords have since grown dull. And their talents, decrepit. Hence, this wreck of a movie plays like a relic straight out of the nineties. A complete waste of money.",4
"Despite its comical poverty however, we wouldn't be telling you the whole story if we failed to mention that it did have a few shining moments where it succeeded in drawing out some bouts of spirited laughter from quite a number of people in the audience. But unfortunately, these shining moments were just to few and far between for them to justify paying serious money to see this. We strongly suggest waiting till 'Makate Must Sell' takes up residence at your neighborhood video rental store where it rightly belongs.",4
"Plagued by everything from terrible story telling to shoddy production to generally very-below average acting, 'Alter Date' is yet another home video that should have been released out of Idumota. And like all that wasn't bad enough, this home video has no ending.",4
"The story is so convoluted and so unnecessarily dragged out that, even after running for a whole ""one hour and fifty minutes"" these fellows still had to use epilogues to explain what happened to the characters. You better believe;  'Alter Date' is a complete waste of money. Please, kindly avoid it!",4
"This movie is ugly. ""Ugly"" must be the word. '1929' is an eyesore. Featuring some of the worst and shabbiest costumes, props and appurtenances to ever come out of Nollywood, '1929' is utterly and extremely displeasing to look at. Goodness gracious! 'Igodo: The Land of the Living Dead' all the way back from 1999 featured way, way better costumes and props. As a matter of fact, even the old school re-enactments of 'Tales by Moonlight' from 1984 were light years better.

Purporting to tell historical heroic stories of sacrifice and resolve against oppressive colonialism, '1929' is so terrible at it that; in all honesty it stands out only as a great disservice to our fallen heroes. We are sure that, if these valiant ancestors could speak to us today,our fallen heroes. We are sure that, if these valiant ancestors could speak to us today, on account of '1929' they would vehemently insist; their stories be left in books. Even now, we continue to sympathize with all the school children who may be forced to see this as part of their History Studies. Please, don't waste your money on this atrociously filthy crap. If you do, you will live to regret it.",4
"Guynman' is special. It is specially stupid. And you know, we have seen many stupid movies in our time. You know this. You know. But 'Guynman' is different. It is stupid in a way that is both unique and noteworthy. It is not recommended for intelligent people, anywhere. We will stop here. We will say no more. We are tired. We surrender. Ha! We surrender. We surrender.",4
Zero Hour' is most definitely bound to be a Zero for you if you grew up on a respectable diet of Hollywood movies. You will find it practically impossible to feel any remnant of genuine appreciation for this relentlessly shoddy attempt at copycatting olden days Hollywood thrillers. Bleeding Jesus!

Seeing this movie is like taking a trip into somebody's bad dream. Complete rubbish. Arrrgh!",4
"Hallmarked by nonsense, 'The Culprit' is complete and utter rubbish! A putrid mess of illogical scenarios mired in blatant foolishness, ridiculous dialogue, amateurish story-telling and extremely horrible acting; 'The Culprit' will drag you to that rare emotional state beyond anger; where you find yourself having no other way to stay sane, than to just start laughing in self pity. Infuriating balderdash, seeing 'The Culprit' is a truly torturous experience. This one is not ""home video"". It is just video. Avoid it even if it is free.",4
" 'Sista Sista' is yet another colossal waste of money starring Enyimma Nwigwe, making it two crappy movies he has headlined in one weekend. Such a shame that he will allow his brand be used to deceive and cajole his fans into splurging on offerings he ought to have known will most definitely turn out to be end-time disasters. And that is precisely what 'Sista Sista' promises for all those who pay a premium to see it- Unmitigated Disaster!",4
" 'Baby Steps' is not a movie. It is ""home video"". Trust us, you don't want to pay to see this. You are better off giving away your money in alms. Like a powerful laxative, 'Baby Steps' will quickly have your tummy churning in disgust, leaving you angry and resentful, for however long you are able to endure. And you are going to need Goliath type strength to endure 'Baby Steps'. It is all round crappy. Literally, ""Crap!"".",4
"The Call' is awesomely retarded. But that's not how it earned that ""Not recommended"". It is not recommended because; despite what is admittedly very crispy production, ultimately 'The Call' plays like just another run-of-the-mill Yoruba-Nolly comedy: You know those legacy Yoruba comic flicks that are typically packed with characters obviously acting retarded through a series of nonsensical scenarios, ensuring they will annoy more than amuse anyone looking for sophisticated and subliminal comedy.",4
"A colossal waste of time and money, 'Knock Out Blessing' is an utterly useless movie that ought not to have been made, or at least not released to the public. So boring and lifeless, it was a real struggle staying awake whilst seeing it. Probably, the only good thing here was watching Demola Adedoyin perfectly play a one eyed assassin. Asides that, the trailer of 'Knock Out Blessing' is a million times more interesting than 'Knock Out Blessing'. You will do well to avoid this, for life. Rubbish!",4
" At approximately two hours long, the far majority of 'God Calling' is unexciting, bland and dreary. We are talking a solid one hour and maybe some twenty or thirty minutes of dryness, dullness and soullessness. Try as hard as it may, 'God Calling' failed to connect for an entire One Hour and Twenty Minutes! The hall was a graveyard with silence and dis-interest holding sway. Though it finally catches steam some twenty minutes to its close, with failure like that, we can't recommend 'God Calling' for cinema. ",4
"
Verdict: Not recommended. 'Charmed' is not charming. While there's a lot of passion behind it, there's just too little quality to make this a worthy offering. It is amateurish, in every way. With amateurish acting, amateurish editing and an aggravatingly unreasonable story to boot, 'Charmed' is not worth paying a premium for. No how!",4
"Psychological Horror, Nollywood Style!!!
meddlecore14 October 2017
A young couple- expecting a new baby- move into a new house, which they acquire for a crazy good deal.

But things might be too good to be true.

Because, as soon as they move in, the man's girlfriend starts seeing things. Things moving, things turning on or opening by themselves...and also a cloaked and hooded demon of some sort.

But nobody else sees it, so they all think she is going crazy from the pregnancy...or has become bewitched.

Eventually, she loses the baby to a miscarriage...but she truly believes that it was stolen by the demon.

Now, he's upset with his wife...and starts to push her away. Until...he starts to see the same demon...

Now he thinks he's going crazy, because of the loss of the baby.

He refuses to believe there is anything wrong with the house, despite his wife being adamant, that is where the problem lies.

But, after he mistakes his wife for the demon and beats her up, his friend convinces him to hire a spiritualist. If only to figure out what is going on.

Turns out, when he bought the house, there was a grave inside. He and his friend dug up the body and moved it, because he feared his wife would not accept living in a house with a dead body.

Now, he must return the man to his grave and leave the house...or he will perish...

But he can't, because they disposed of his bones in a way that they can' be retrieved. So, they use a psychic to settle a deal with the angry spirit...to return the house to his family's heirs...so that they can be forgiven.

The rest of this 2 hour film (it's not short!), is the guy sleuthing his way to find out whose house it originally was...and it culminates with a weird nuclear family situation...and the mentioning of a war I had to google (though I had actually heard of it, just not by that name).

Honestly, this film is bad, but in a great way. I enjoyed the sh*t out of this. It had me laughing- at the bad jokes, the cheesy scare gags, the mediocre acting, and over the fact that the lead actor is the Nollywood version of Cuba Gooding Jr.

And just think about it...this is 1 of 105 films Ikechukwu Onyeka has made in 12 years.

That's insane turnout.

And this entertained me for 2 hours...so good f*cking on him! ",4
"I haven't read the book, but having read the Wikipedia summary, I imagine a mini-series would have better suited the material. As it is, you get no sense of place or character because too much has to be glossed over to fit it all in.",4
"""They deported me from the USA""

Some things are universal, wherever you go you will find a film student producing a self-righteous movie about how difficult it is to produce movies, and Green White Green is the most typical example of this archetype.

The film features all of the hallmarks of a poorly produced student film: royalty-free music, unprofessional and generally very bad actors, some inspired visuals but generally poorly composed cinematography, dreadful editing, and a clear lack of confidence in their own creative vision that the film's narrative must be meta and ironic in some sense. If I wanted to see this calibre of filmmaking I would have attended the screening of films from production students at my own university, which I did not. The only distinction between this and the films that my peers produce is the slight novelty of this being a Nigerian production however that largely feels like a wasted opportunity. Themes of class and wealth are certainly discussed but are massively overlooked. For all the empty platitudes the film preaches about wealth inequality there are clear instances wherein the film exhibits its own prejudices towards impoverished people, be it the unfavourable light the rival group of lads are shown in because of their background, blatant xenophobia towards people of the impoverished nations (particularly other African nations and the middle east) and generally holding the West (particularly Northern Europe and the United States) to high regard. This is unsurprising from a director who was taught filmmaking at NYU (New York University). In interviews director Abba Makama speaks at length about how the film represents the different ethnic groups of Nigeria and puts homegrown, indigenous African artistry on a pedestal, when the film itself has such an overt occidental vision and hardly ever properly explores themes of race and poverty. As virtuous and important as he believes his film to be, Green White Green is just a dime a dozen not only in terms of its typical film student approach but also it being lost in a sea of Nollywood movies, a vast number of which more adequately explore themes of race and Nigerian nationality. Remove those themes and this is just as generic a movie that anyone with a couple years of formal education could produce.

And it comes with the territory of a student film that there might be some inspired elements. A clear admiration for the canon of film that came before it, some ambitious cinematography, a fairly decent script, again these things are not uncommon of a student film but aid in making Green White Green at least engaging to a certain extent.",4
"In the Figurine 2 friends are into the same girl. One is kind of a jerk and the other is a nerdy nice guy. Guess which one gets the girl... The nerdy guy finds a relic that gives him good luck and changes him from Steve Urkel to Stephan Urkel. I guess in this tale after the 7 years of good luck is up, you get 7 years bad luck. 

I was kind of digging it at first but the movie has pacing issues, needs to be edited, and is way too long. There was a part where I thought it was almost over only to realize there was 40 more minutes. That's about 30 mins too long for this. Kind of disappointing.",4
"
""Are you telling me that you're on an Okada wearing a 1,000 Naira dress? Are you mad?""

What a great introduction to Nollywood. This is a campy drama/romance/comedy about a man and woman who get their phones swapped, and now need to swap them back. They go on a crazy adventure and fall in love in the process. With a few different cultural references, this film could have been made in any other country. While it's a fairly tired plot, it's made with a such an earnestness and sincerity that is charming.

I think Wale Ojo and Nse Ikpe Etim are incredibly watchable actors. I like them both a lot. Everyone in the film is enjoyable in one way or another, even if most of the people in this film aren't professional actors (or at least have limited experience with film acting). The production value is a little sloppy, but director Kunle Afolayan clearly has a grip on what he's doing and is influenced by western cinema. The jokes and the way the story hits so many different tones lack polish, and I'd struggle to say it's a 'good' or 'artistic' film, but it's very easy to watch.

this film completely catches you by surprise in the most unexpected way as it turns into a sort of musical: the music is vibrant and colorful but it's weird cause it seems like it's not even music, they're not even singing?

Credited for catalyzing direct-to-video distribution format in Nigerian cinema. This reportedly had a cross-cultural success so unheard of before that, local markets were later flooded with numerous releases borrowing money ritual theme introduced here. In what looks like a fairly well, right on trend assembled production for its time. Rapu taps into discontent in everyman to gradually elevate the storyline — into a morale bound supernatural drama.

Regrettably, there's a large disparity between what it is doing & what the one it is evident like. Even larger disparity exists for those who watch today to come closer anywhere near the shooked excitement Nigerians probably felt — watching both the parts on VHS in 90s. A runtime of beyond-five hours is far too stretch in making protagonist pay for his committed sins, to be all of a sudden released on a religious gaslighting note.

"So this is a disjointed mess of a movie, and given that one of the main actors is also the writer and producer and that pretty much every supporting character is falling over themselves to tell the protagonists how immensely nifty they are, I'd guess that this is, in fact, a rather crappy vanity project.",4

"During its theatrical run, Omo Ghetto: The Saga became the highest grossing Nollywood movie of all time. Of course, making plenty money doesn't automatically equate to being a good film, but for some idealic reason of wanting perfection or some semblance of it, I held onto a notion that Omo Ghetto: The Saga wouldn't be a bad, bad movie. I was wrong. I wonder how many more times I'd be wrong before I finally fully understand the writing on the wall - the chances of Nollywood making a great film is pretty slim.

'Omo Ghetto: The Saga' has obvious good intentions and a decent story it plays close to its heart, but it's held back by some of the same vices that has bedevilled many other hyped Nollywood flicks in recent memory, most notably its weak screenplay with dialogues that leave so much to be desired. It is also undeservedly long, and has a plethora of pointless and unlikeable supporting characters that take up a large of the screentime without an iota of development, among many other issues.

Mostly set in the slums, the movie (actually a sequel to its 2010 predecessor, for those who don't know) spotlights Lefty, a character incredibly brought to life by Funke Akindele, and her dual life as a child of Askamaya, the titular ghetto, and also that of a wealthy home. Balancing these two different realities takes a toll on her and on the people around her. In many parts, the movie pays homage to the colourful, complex lives of gangsters it draws a clear inspiration from, but, it's its inability to actually weave all the interesting moving parts into one captivating piece that ends up being its greatest undoing. At best, Omo Ghetto: The Saga is a sour, overstretched moral instruction video disguised as a feel-good movie, and at worst, watching it is a complete waste of time and resources that could've been better spent on something more productive.

Once again, this is a good opportunity to reiterate that Nollywood really needs to start doing better with its stories if it wants to be taken more seriously in the global scene. Imagine someone in the abroad asked for our highest grossing movie list and this shows up? We've cracked the intricasies of picture quality, can we stop exchanging this testimonial for a decent screenplay, please?",4

Shortlisted for Nigeria’s entry to the 2021 Oscars, this certainly is a movie. In as much as it was filmed, has performances, and something resembling a plot. I’m not familiar with any of the cast or creative, but some of them are pretty big names in Nollywood, and apparently have done a lot better than this.

"Well, when the main positive thing that people list about the film is the colour grading, you probably know you’re not going to experience an amazing story. And for a supernatural horror thriller revenge movie that features serpentine possession… it ironically lacks a lot of bite.

Idia Aisien proves being beautiful and having a slamming figure isn’t enough to be seductive. It requires a force of personality and her performance just seems a bit flat for me. Once the revenge murder spree kicks in there’s no real suspense or atmosphere conjured. Everything just seems very staid. And when a film isn’t very involving, a 140 minute runtime is most unwelcome.

But it’s not without merit, there’s a decent score and some very pretty cinematography here. Oh and I have I mentioned the colour grading? Really is the best thing about this film. I’ve never seen the original but I can see why its fans aren’t happy with the remake. It’s beautifully bland.",4

With terrible acting and an outstandingly imbecilic story-line, this ridiculous low grade Disney wannabe excuse of a comedy will make anyone and everyone lose interest in Nollywood forever. Such a sham. And a terrible waste, this is what comes of writing stories and producing movies with the sole intention of advertising an amusement park, but people shouldn't have to pay to watch long-form adverts. We strongly suggest you stay far away from this filth if you value your time and energy.",4
"Zena' isn't a terrible movie. A lot of effort went into making it good. One can easily see great effort in the costuming and propping- While they aren't particularly spectacular, their above-average quality advertises the amount of time, energy and money expended seeking excellence for 'Zena'. The acting was also quite good. The Problem with 'Zena' is that it is boring as hell. The story it tells is too basic to be remembered. Ultimately, 'Zena' proved too unappealing to stir any excitement in its audience. Put you to sleep, it will.",4
"Purporting to tell historical heroic stories of sacrifice and resolve against oppressive colonialism, '1929' is so terrible at it that; in all honesty it stands out only as a great disservice to our fallen heroes. We are sure that, if these valiant ancestors could speak to us today, on account of '1929' they would vehemently insist; their stories be left in books. Even now, we continue to sympathize with all the school children who may be forced to see this as part of their History Studies. Please, don't waste your money on this atrociously filthy crap. If you do, you will live to regret it.",4
"The Final List' is a concoction of relentless hogwash. It will drive you to the very edge of insanity, with its amateurish story-telling, terrible acting and production values straight out of the late 1980s. Such a horrible offering, 'The Final List' is reminiscent of series made for NTA Channel 7 of blessed memory. If you desire to keep your sanity, stay far away from this pile of smoking rubbish, lest it be your final movie.",4
"Funke' tells a very basic story that could have been powerful and relevant had it been told two decades ago. Its lateness aside, the real problem with 'Funke' is that it is boring and unexciting. The trailer is way more interesting than the movie. Only a free ticket or a deep bargain could possibly make seeing this worthwhile. You are better off waiting for it to get on TV where it belongs.",4
"Absolutely not recommended for sophisticated people. 'Seven and a Half Dates' is a sham, reminiscent of Nollywood from the early 2,000s. Don't waste a Kobo on it in cinema.",4
Payday' is a movie we so much wanted to love. Unfortunately it turned out to be a rain of illogicalities buffeted by amateurish acting; akin to a creche open-day drama presentation for parents. It was terrible!,4
"Nollywood does the evil-kid-run-amok movie, replacing creepiness, tension and terror with broad comedy, needlessly over-long scenes and general irritation.
Dada is the diabolical kid in question. After sabotaging a local workman's equipment for dangerous laughs, the locals force him out of his own village and he is reluctantly sent to live with an uncle in the city.
Once in the big city and left to his devices (why?!), Dada impersonates a Profit in order to acquire an old TV and persuade a woman to undress. When that scam is eventually exposed, Dada gives all of his uncle's savings to a couple of conmen.
'You are killing me Dada!' & then... 'You have killed me Dada! quickly become the mantra of the exasperated uncle.
Finally Dada forms his own police force (made up of local grown men!) and harasses innocent motorists at checkpoints in the neighbourhood...
With its ever-present nauseating score soundtracking almost the whole film regardless of what is happening and Dada's initially amusing, but quickly grating mugging for the camera, Baby Police becomes a film to tolerate rather than enjoy.",4
"The plot is unbelievably bad, and the actors obviously do not comport themselves in a way that suggests they believe in the script. The story has so many loose ends that give you the feeling of undone food, rushed to guests. The dialogue in Unroyal is one of the worst I have experienced as a movie reviewer, and I have heard terrible dialogues. Not a single line is memorable and there is no cliché to recall. ",4
"The movie had no subplots that we could follow. Also, One thing that could have provided some authenticity was to see RMD in an actual winery to provide backing for his 200 Million Naira loan for the business. The only place he talked about wines was at the dinner table. That is like having a Fast n Furious movie in which there is talk about cars but no car shop scene or something of the sort.",4
"The cinematography in the movie was basic and was not too exciting, and the movie got boring and tedious in some parts. ",4
"Bland. Mechanical. Tactless. Frankly speaking, 'Esohe' is a good attempt. The only problem is; we are at a loss as to what they were trying to create. Ultimately however, regardless of whatever it was supposed to be; in the end, 'Esohe' turned out to be a below average offering that plays more like a stage play that is boring as hell or a maniacally disjointed slide-show that is poor at communicating its own message. And that's not even the worst part.",4
Not recommended. 'Esohe' is too stressful to be any fun.,4
"Fine Wine could have been more exciting, but the potential of the story was not fully explored and it was further marred by a very sluggish pace. If this movie were a bottle of wine, it has some maturing to do. ",4
