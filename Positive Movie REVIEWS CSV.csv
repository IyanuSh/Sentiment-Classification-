"Beautiful acting, beautiful directing, not so great story
I had to open an account just to review this movie. The acting in this was of the hook. There is some serious talent shown. It was beautiful to look at too. I however was disappointed by the story line. By the end of the movie I didn't feel the title ""King of boys"" was justified. The running time was also too long. That said, I love the cast and cinematography...the costumes and music.....the blend of languages and realistic depiction of our country (Nigeria). This is a beautiful work of art.",7,
"Good movie, would love to see a continuation of this movie.",7,
"One thing I like about the movie is the way the story was told and the ways the actors interpreted it. The writers, directors and cinematographers deserve an applaud for this effort. But she should have cut off some unnecessary scenes including music performances. Good movie export for Nollywood. Got to admit the best I have seen so far in years. My star rating is for Nollywood not international. Thanks",7,
"If you enjoyed the Godfather then you'll enjoy this. The storyline was beautiful and the plot twist at the end was incredible but there was some very unrealistic scenes that prove to be plot holes. SPOILER ALERT. The shooter of Eniola's daughter had his hand high in the air only for the bullet to hit her stomach. The phrase which the police chief had used when dropping the bribe is not one someone would repeat unconsciously. And finally the fire at the prison only showed outside when the officer entered the prison there was no fire in sight neither was the place hot. By all logic Eniola was supposed to die in that prison due to suffocation but she miraculously was unharmed, the prison bars didn't even get heated. But all in all the plot is very solid.",7,
"On a Nollywood scale I'll give this movie an 9 because of it's unique storyline and excellent production which sets it aside from other Nigerian movies but just like other Nigerian movies it was excessively long and had extras who didn't know their roles, some part of the movie was unrealistic eg. the fire on the cell part but that's not the issue, the issue is this; as i was watching the movie I couldn't help but feel nostalgic, after a few minutes of brainstorming I remembered where i had seen the movie before if you can't remember I'll remind you, it's Al Pacino meets Francis Ford, yes The Godfather II to be precise. My original rating was an 8 but because of it's lack of originality i give it a 4 on a world scale and 9 on Nollywood scale. If other Nigerian directors can learn from this and just remake Hollywood classics the Nigerian cinema would be a better place.",7,
"An imporvement on most Nigerian Movies, but not perfect
This movie was recomendd to me by my wife. it's a good overal production with some very good acting and production design. Eni Salami is a chracter that sticks with you long after the movie has finished. My main complaint with the movie is the lack of competent editing. Easily 30 mins could have been cut out. There was lots of over drawn out dialog and scenes that basically did not need to be included. In summary a good movie, one of the better Nigerian productions, but could have been much better, with some improved post produciton work",7,

"Still one of the Best Nigerian films of 2017
Isoken is a great film showcasing the culture of the area of the country. The layout, filming, colors and dressing tell much of the tradition quite well. The film has quite a good inject of laughter and great acting (Isoken, her mother, black boyfriend). However, like most Nigerian films, it becomes too predictable and by halfway, you can guess the end. which is usually a Cinderella ending. the last 10 minutes do the most harm to the film: flying out the next day and the whole family rushing out to meet the new bf at a party ??. Not in nature of the culture around here.

The film is a worthy film of Nigeria and great to learn some of the culture. Especially about weddings and how they are planned. Great work. Expect a better 2nd part someday",7,
"Great Movie, Great Acting.

Great movie, great acting. would be nice to see a part 2 of it.",7,
"Not serious but hilarious

Hardly was there a period of 5 minute in this movie with nothing to smile, chuckle or laugh about. I don't think there is a Nigerian movie that beats this in it's genre (Fictional Comedy). The movie effects were as well commendable.",7,
"Honest review from European Woman with Netflix subscription
I couldn't understand the low rating and the very high reviews some people stated where unrealistic or even paid to write. Since the movie popped up on my Netflix home screen I decided to give it a go and write an honest unpaid review. And this is just my opinion. I am a woman from Europe, an entirely different culture than the African one, but since this is a movie, and I watched it, I am entitled to my opinion! At first I was skeptical and I couldn't figure out what to think of it the first 30 minutes. But the acting was fine, I totally and absolutely loved the chemistry between the strong female lead and her uncle. What a character! This wasn't a heavy, dramatic movie, more a light hearted fast paced flick with a lot of elements that are almost comical. Hallmark like camera and music and I liked the directing and camera. The only thing I wasn't really happy about was that the movie quite suddenly was over. It could have used like ten minutes more of even a bit longer to work things out with the possible love interest. Conclusion: I liked it, I enjoyed myself, it was not a master piece, but a nice watch. Well done.",7,

"Very good, if not wholly fulfilling

It's unfortunate that 'The figurine' hasn't gotten a great deal of attention outside of Nigeria, as it's a worthy view - a drama and thriller, with supernatural elements, that keeps us watching from start to finish.

The film follows two friends, just setting out in life, who find an abandoned shrine and a totem inside that local legend says will grant seven years of good fortune. The catch is that legend says seven years of bad luck will follow.

I stumbled onto 'The figurine' while searching for something else, totally unaware of the accolades and high regard this film has garnered in Nigeria and beyond. That I'd never heard of it otherwise speaks to the rank politics of cinema in the US, where any feature produced outside North America or the United Kingdom is blandly pigeonholed as an ""international feature"" and barely gets any press, let alone release. As is often the case, this movie deserves more broad consideration.

This is more of a character study than anything else. There is drama, and suspense, and a mild sense of unease pervades the latter half of the film as tension ramps up. The cast all perform very well in their roles to bring the screenplay to life. Despite the prominence in the narrative of the noted figurine, the real focus is on the tangled webs of the relationships and interactions between characters. And it's very engaging, especially leading into the climax.

There are no specific faults that come to mind, yet personally I just find that 'The figurine' doesn't entirely connect. I can't put my finger on it, but I was somehow expecting something more. It's very enjoyable, but despite the tension and suspense in the story, it ultimately also feels understated at the finale, like something is missing. Maybe that's just me, though; in any case, putting aside that minor misgiving, I've no detractions to make.

Even a cursory glance at material about the making of 'The figurine' illustrates the hard work that went into producing the film, and I'm pleased to say it all paid off. Cinema industries all around the world deserve more attention from viewers, and we should endeavor to expand our purview - and 'The figurine' shows that there's a wealth of good movies to discover in Nollywood.",7,
"In a movie which seems like it should have been a mini-series, we follow a relationship, which grows into a family, over the course of 20 years in Nigeria.",7,
"Not my type of movie but my type of actors

Remember to see the end of the review I got to know about this movie when my very good friend told me about it and the actors and I was like what? How can Chiwetel Ejiofor act in a Nigeria based movie,I know the movie has to do with UK and stuff but it was mainly in Nigeria. I know he's a Nigerian but,well I guess he gets paid to act,let's get back to the movie. The movie's talking about what a tribe in Nigeria did in the past just to gain independence and become a republic and how a man and his wife suffered from it and some other stuff going on in their life. I don't really watch Nigerian movies because I have got lot of hate for the country and his people but I wanted to watch this movie BC Chiwetel Ejiofor was in it. The one thing I didn't get is why the hell would you budget N1.60billion on a Nigeria movie that's rubbish,but you got top actors in it tho but it still ain't worth it. Its a really really nice movie for Nigerians and some others not just my type of movie. Its getting a 5+2 for Chiwetel Ejiofor being in it. Must watch Well if you don't agree with my review or you got any arguments",7,
"Sister Bond

Unlike some of my friends, I had not read the book prior to seeing the movie. In a Facebook discussion, Half of a Yellow Sun got excellent reviews on both the book and the movie, so I decided to check the movie out. I deeply appreciated seeing a movie with an emotional bond between two sisters who were connected in so many ways, but disconnected by romance and political views. Perhaps more intriguing were the circumstances that tore them apart, brought them together again. The movie actors were superb and each character was perfectly cast for their roles. I only wish movies like this would reach more people. It tells a story that is and was real about power, war and political unrest in Africa. I plan on reading the book as well.",7,
"Beautiful production but a weak storyline

The only reason I'm not going to give this a 10 out of 10 star review is because I found the story lacking. Many of the major characters weren't fully explored and were therefore wasted, and some of the plot twists made absolutely no sense. That aside, this series is an exquisite work of art. Everything from the cast to the music was perfect. You couldn't ask for a better actors, or ask for more beautiful locations. The scenery is a marvel to behold. The wardrobe mouth watering. The acting was superb.... Charley Boy is a delight to watch on camera. This was a wonderful effort by Kemi Adetiba and I'm really happy I got a chance to watch this. Looking forward to more and I'm sure the stories will improve.",7,
"A Good One
Hmmm... This was a movie. A GOOD ONE and that's about it. Buh let's break it down a bit.

Plot Kemi is still one of the best story tellers of all time in Nigeria. She has shown that time and again. From her music videos to movies. She knows how to tell and finish a story. She puts you at the edge of your sit in suspence and drops your jaw with a finish. Only this time she dragged on too much. It was unnecessarily longer than the movie should have been. I mean she spent the first episode rightfully introducing the queen and wasted too much time showing pain from the lead.

That was too much in my opinion. 8/10

Acting Man.... I think she focused more on the lead characters than she did for the rest. It's a body of work. I believe d energy should flow around all. The add-ons had bad or unnecessary script lines. The lead guard was too stiff the second in command was better. Needless to say the leads were magnificent. Jaw dropping performance. Second time Toni tones is giving me chills down my spine. Hot damn 8/10

SFX Special effects needed a lot more. I've seen much better in Nigerian movie. It's big budget movie I expected more. 5/10

Direction Kemi wrote and directed that means she brought her imagination to people's minds and they loved it. I applaud her. Buh like I said the acting was focused on some key moments and leads. Some parts lacked emotion and Its unfortunate cause Kemi always has scenes that give goosebumps. The scene in the beginning for instance thats EPIC what a way to begin. The best emotional scene in the movie in my opinion was the reporters argument with his wife in his apartment. Then the graveyard scene in the first episode was Iconic. I think she dwelled too much on it but still, literal goosebumps. 7/10

Script Although better than most Nigerian movies, needed more work. Some lines were better left unsaid. Especially the add-ons like the elders. They needed to be scene not heard. 7/10

Cast Mad choice of team but not totally on point. They came with their A game. Charlie Boy over acted his role though. Making him fake. At a point he was counting his words. He wasn't as natural as the rest. For a supporting role with a very important role to play, he didn't do justice to it. Sank the movie for me. I think Kemi was going with bad and dangerous but sexy something like Jafar in Aladdin or Rasputin Anastasia or Scar in Lion King. Bad buh like-able. Charlie boy was a No no. 7/10

Soundtrack An important part of every movie. This movie lacked a lot of that and audio effects in core areas were missing. 5/10

I like the fact that she never focuses on one Ethnic group. She mixed it all. Love that. Like I said it was a GOOD movie.",7,
"Good for a first.

A Naija Christmas As with almost any new high budget Nigerian movie, it aims for comedic relief and heavily lies in tropes. A fairly straightforward plot that delivers nothing new, save being the first Nigerian Christmas themed movie. Because of the heavy reliance on comedic elements, the plot isn't allowed to develop to have darker moments as such moments were snuffed out (a little letdown.) The casting was sweet. Seeing many familiar faces from YouTube series getting a shot into the spotlight was thrilling! (Segilola ogidan, Ade laoye & Abayomi Alvin.) Mercy Johnson finally gets a new nollywood movie where she can shine appropriately (Seven and a half dates & the ghost and the tout too, she can finally be forgiven for those travesties.)",7,
"Funny Christmas Comedy

This movie had me cracking up from the start. It's about 3 single brothers who are disappointing their mother because they haven't yet gotten married / have no kids. The brothers all have different reasons why they're still bachelors and it's a funny movie. I absolutely love Nigerian culture. 7/10.",7,
"Originally Unoriginal

The story has a lovely premise.

But if you're gonna tell a Nigerian story, at least tell it in a Nigerian way.

I couldn't help but notice the undertones of Western culture (and yes, a lot of Nigerian modern lifestyle is influenced by the West,) but to go so far as even patterning the dialogue after Western culture, that's too far.

The breakups and the relationship dynamics broke my last straw.

I love this movie, but as an ardent observer of Western cinema, it feels like a copy.

Whether it is a Nigerian copy of a Western story, or a Western copy of a Nigerian story, sometimes I just can't tell.",7,
"Funny

Funny and good acting. A different cool vibes.

I like how the main character is put of the ordinary and how the women stand up to the men.",7,
"A good sequel but a remake would have been far better for good story buildup

I must say I commend the director and his acting too ( Ramsey Nouah).. but the story would have been appreciated if started from the beginning (remake of the first movie in 1992) then later this... but I guess the actors like Kanayo, Okonkwo etc May not cut out the first act nor the sequel and they needed to make sure they are featured in the movie anyways.",7,

"Captures the quintessence of the horrid issue

More than 11% of all level students experience rape or sexual assault! Only 20% of female students report such incident to authorities. Even though 2/3rd of college students experience sexual harassment in campus, 89% of colleges report no such incident on campuses. (Source: American Association of University Women) And the data in a country like Nigeria is quite appalling! ""The majority (69.8%) of the respondents had been sexually harassed, with the main perpetrators being male classmates and lecturers. And requests to do something sexual in exchange for academic favors is 32.2%."" (Source: National Library of Medicine) The story contextualizes this horrid issue. It is based on the true events. Good cinematography esp few sceneries from Cape Verde and Senegal... .However, shorter runtime could have made this movie crispier. Also, the script writing lacks subtleness with somewhat middle-of-the-road dialogues. But it is still a MUST watch movie as it still captures the quintessence of the issue and delivers a clear message.",7,
"OK but WAY TOO LONG

I quite agree with what many others have said here about this movie. It tells an important story (based on a true one evidently) but the movie is WAY TOO LONG at two and a half hours and the ""acting"" is not really convincing at all. The acting in particular from the Gloria character was just dreadful. Every scene she played involved eye-rolling that was way over the top and quite unnecessary. I live in Thailand where Thai TV programs and movies are also way over acted which led me to believe that ""Gloria"" had probably done her acting training in Thailand rather than in West Africa.

This story really could have been very adequately told in 90 minutes. The extra hour just made it somewhat annoying. All the same, it was a decent movie and I rate it 7.0

"Fresh POV
It is not the kind of cinema we are used to in the western hemisphere, but the production highlights not only a story to develop, but also the colors and culture of the region in which it takes place.

A script with more potential to be exploited, but with good camerawork and direction. We can consider the good performances, which cover any non-obvious lack of the film.",7,

Great story line. Sex offenders, sex addition Depict( the roots of addiction, what could have caused it and the life time effects it has on people and lives. Very touching.

I certainly would recommend watching it.",7,
"Cute...

It bothered me a lot of Izu's behavior, I could imagine the seriousness of his wife's actions for such ignorance, but yes, the reason was strong, as if there was a justification for rudeness and violence (even if the violence does not actually come to light, and stay in the verbal scope), the film has a gospel, talks about forgiveness and our actions, I really liked this simple Nigerian... And the plot twist, it was painful to say the least... Cute...",7,
"Wow

This movie really made me change my relationship for the best. Great movie. The movie did start off slow but it definitely kept me interested. The flash backs really made the ending even more intense because everything came together.

"
A great children movie

I think the Mirror Boy is a great children movie, simple in spirit, yet powerful, effective and well performed. It may seem almost nothing takes place in the adventure, but the spiritual concepts developed throughout are interesting and deep. It's truly a journey of initiation into the culture of the ancestors.

The soundtrack is awesome, varied and rich, quite appealing and also bridging tradition and contemporary concepts! For me the best performance is from Osita Iheme as the Mirror Boy.

This was my introduction to Nollywood cinema and I loved it. Will be looking for more Nigerian movies.",7,
"Scattershot but still packing some impacts

Being the directing and/or screenwriting debut of a well-known actor always loads a movie with a lot of baggage and expectations, for every critical darling like ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""Gone Baby Gone"" you get a forgettable ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" or ""Déficit"". The baggage only gets heavier when it also happens to be openly based on the actor's own life story. The last such case of this double-duty debut I can think of lead to the multi-award winning and nominated ""Lady Bird"" by Greta Gerwig, so... no pressure.

""Farming"" is British actor Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's telling of his own life story having been ""farmed out"" as a baby in the late 1960s to a couple in Tilbury. This was a common practice with African, mostly Nigerian, couples in the UK, where they would hire white, British foster parents to care for their children in the hope that it would lead to better lives for them. Many of these white families were working-class, not indifferent to the pay involved in fostering and unprepared for the unique challenges that the race relations of the practice could lead to. Adewale's film avatar Enitan is also farmed out, taken back for a few years by his biological parents to their native Nigeria, has constant identity crises after his return to England and these result in him joining a white supremacist skinhead gang.

As a testament to its staying cultural impact, Dave Chappelle's ""Black Klansman"" character is probably the first thing that comes to mind when picturing a black person joining a white supremacist group, but the situation is not even remotely played for laughs here. For the most part, ""Farming"" is brutal, Enitan's crisis and isolation, strong enough to make him want to join any group that'll take him even if it's just to hate on him, is greatly portrayed in all its troubling phases by Damson Idris (the actor playing him as a child, along with the rest of the child performers are unfortunately a lot less successful). Damson is not alone in carrying the movie, his strongest peer being an electrifying John Dagleish, playing the skinhead gang's leader with such power that one could understand Eni's wish to follow him, even through the obvious hate. Keeping the film from becoming monotonously bleak is an incredibly stylish production design (even if some locations are clearly too modern for their time setting) and the occasional gorgeous, almost classic, grainy stock, high-contrast photography coupled with a great selection of songs related to the Black British experience.

Among the rest of the cast, Kate Beckinsale is to be noted as she's never before been seen playing a character like this toxic-yet-watchable mother, and she does it well, it's just a shame that the character itself is almost a stock one in modern drama thanks to ""Tonya"", ""The Fighter"" and the already-mentioned ""Lady Bird"". AAA playing the avatar of his own father is interesting too, for the role this might have in his own process of dealing with the events depicted.

For all its audiovisual strengths the movie unfortunately falls short on the story department specially near the end. In an attempt to make the previous brutality end in less of a downer note, the final minutes try to wrap everything up a tad too nicely. This along with some unsure pacing decisions denote the nature of this movie as an opera prima, fortunately not to the extent of detracting from the end result though. Finally, considering the U.S.'s role as the leading cultural force in the world, where most of the art related to the race relations of black people originates from, it is refreshing to see a different aspect of these as they happen in other countries, specially when they're told so vividly by creatives who've lived through and been inspired by them.",7,

I recommend this movie to anyone interested into this topic - or anyone who enjoy great movies! There is some images that really hit at the right place... Damson Idris is really something...

Interesting how open the characters are to speaking about their relationships and with restraining anger during such emotional circumstances. The idea that some things are what you like and some things just are, is an interesting cultural value. The idea that you are wedded to your past and the denial of self renewal and expansion leads on to the truth somehow. The subtitles were delayed a few seconds making some parts hard to follow and reducing the overall quality of the film. The microphones were also poorly operated.

Why does this movie have two different names and two different ""looks""?

Stuff like this is why. Arrogant corporations exploiting second and third world countries. Getting tax credits to it. The acting was okay. I overlooked it because the story was so good. The music for the credits was not appropriate. This is a serious subject, why play an upbeat song? I'm one of those people that actually sticks around for the credits. The music was distracting.",7,

"Soapy entertainment

I've never before seen a Nollywood film, so I was intrigued as to what director Biyi Bandele's 'Fifty' would be like. As it turns out, it was pretty much an African version of 'Dynasty'!

The film is about four affluent Lagos women who are 'of a certain age'. There's Elizabeth, a celebrity obstetrician whose taste in young men has led her daughter to disown her; Kate, a party planner becoming increasingly influenced by religion; Maria, a high-flying construction executive who discovers she is pregnant; and Tola, a reality television star with a dark family secret. Their story lines join, separate and join again before resolving themselves in best TV movie fashion.

It's not challenging at all, but certainly diverting and entertaining. Although all four lead actresses get their turns to emote, only Nse Ikpe-Etim, as Kate, has a consistently challenging role as the reason for her character's turn to religion is revealed. Bandele makes full use of Lagos' skyline with sweeping establishing shots over the city, although by the end of the film you may feel you've seen quite enough of the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge, as attractive a piece of engineering as it is.",7,

While waiting in a bar for a boat to cross a river, a man tells the story of Javé, a small town in the country of Bahia doomed to be submerged by the waters of a hydroelectric dam. When the illiterate dwellers of Javé find that their village will be flooded, they decide to ""scientifically"" document the story of Javé to show the historical importance of the place and present motives to stop the construction of the hydroelectric. However, only the former postman and persona non-grata Antônio Biá (José Dumont), who used the intimacy of the villagers to save his job in the post office, can write, but the population assigns him to register in a book the report of the remembrances of the storytellers.

""Narradores de Javé"" is a funny and dramatic simple story supported by a good and original screenplay, great direction and excellent performances of the cast formed by actors, actresses and amateurish simple persons. This low-budget movie presents a great political final speech of Antonio Biá, in one of the best moments of this little gem, when he shows the lack of importance of them to the powerful.",7,

beauty in simplicity
Emerenciano13 November 2006
Once more we can find art in the simplest of ordinary things. As days go by I am more convinced that we don't really need to look for vary elaborated films (nothing against them, of course) to see beauty and value. European and Brazilian cinema are live evidences of this thought. There many films which may be cited as great examples (many of them I have written about here in IMDb) of this.

""Narradores de Javé"", a generally hidden treasure even here in Brazil, is a very good Brazilian film with a simple, but good story. In a small village called Javé, the inhabitants are told to leave their home once the government plans to built a hydroelectric dam in the place. In despair, the population decides to write a document where all the values and traditions of the place would be together and thus stop the construction of the dam. The problem is, nobody in the village is able to write such paper. The solution is to invite Antônio Biá, a former inhabitant of the city, to do the job. Antônio then starts interviewing the people in the city and hears all the stories they have to tell. He has to decide what is true, legend or just a lie. The interviews happen among discussions, arguments and even physical fights. Many funny situations arise, specially for Brazilian who can enjoy the local accent and jokes. International audience, can have a very good time too, once the acting is superb and the scenery is beautiful.",7,
"A story told like no other
Sharon Ooja (Oloture) brings her expert acting skills into this one, alongside supporting actress Omowunmi Dada (Linda) who also did a great job. Even though it's not based on true life story, the movie centers around things that happen in our world and gets almost unspoken of daily. Here, the director Kenneth Gyang doesn't care about personal feelings, but goes straight to give us a raw and unblemished look into this brutal ordeal on human trafficking, while still leaving room for lots of emotions. Pure art and a good premise, as most movies should be. The summary is these things happen and even if it sucks, that's how life is, this film shows us just that! My ratings may seem harsh, because I found some terrible plot holes, which would be spoiling it if I discussed them, but I think by international standards, the rating is fine. It's a quality movie, watch it with an open mind.",7,
"Good but Kinda Cheesy

I liked this murder mystery from Nigeria. 

The film cinematography almost felt like a filmed play at times.....but that is just my observation.

The plot was thick and readable part way in but far enough in to keep my interest.

I really liked the setting, the clothing, and the characterizations. The best obviously, is the old inspector. 

This gave me a feel for what I hear is an up and coming Nigerian film scene.

The mixture of culture and language was very interesting. Some English, mostly subtitles. Some British influence, mostly Nigerian.

Cheesier parts like the murder scenes and investigation of murder scenes at really real locations sparked my interest.....I guess. On the whole, the nature of these just added to my interest in the film.",7,
"A good Nigerian movie

The war in Nigeria is a very regrettable conflict and this film shows us the dark side of the country; it's a good action drama movie.",7,
"Juju stories is a three short stories in a 1 hr 20 mins movie. The first story 'Love Portion' is where the juice is, the second story is 'Yam' is a woeful failure and 'Suffer The Witch' is eerily good. It is a win, 2 out of 3 were good. ",7,

If this is a subject you like then it's a decent movie.

But it is extremely subdued and slow. The movie makes it worse and often is as loud as the speaking.",7,

Well made, well played, good actors, even though it might seem a bit slow at times (and over 2 hrs altogether), I still think it is worth watching anytime. Of course, it is not the brightest and happiest movie to watch during these corona and pandemic times...

but I liked it.",7,
"Realistic but slow pacing and very melodramatic.

Good acting, based on true events and a decent story. The pacing was a little too slow for my liking and some scenes feel like a made-for-tv movie (the cheese music and the over dramatization).

Overall watchable if you know what you are getting into ahead of time.",7,

I loved it. Very different from the normal Naija movies you watch. I loved the strory line, the acting; especially Miss Balogun's, the pace and the quality. I would give it a 7/10 for originality.",7,
"Funny.

The culture is on point, and I get a lot of laughs. It's great to see black women as the main - so refreshing - although what would be more refreshing and powerful is to see black women rock their natural hair. The wigs are dialing the black girl magic a little down.

But the production is great, and I enjoy the dynamics of the characters.",7,
"Insight into Nigerian life

This movie might be hard to watch if you have no affinity with West Africa. It gives a good insight into the Nigerian way of things. I would surely recommend it to anyone to watch. Watch it, learn from it.",7,
"A captivating and funny critique of Nigeria...

This is a really vibrant, dream-like film with a completely original soundtrack. I have never visited Nigeria or watched any other movies made in Nigeria and I really enjoyed getting a glimpse of life in Lagos. It was a little hard to understand the characters at first, so I put on the subtitles and that helped... A lot.

The story follows the main character named Raymond as he transforms into a costumed spirit, or masquerade, named Okoroshi. Okoroshi gives good fortune and wealth to the good and punishes the wicked. Watching a giant, purple, shaggy-looking spirit dance and interact with the different characters was great.

Some scenes dragged a little but overall I really enjoyed this filmmaker's critique of modern Nigeria (and other parts of the world). He definitely has something to say.",7,

"Slowly blossoming into something beautiful

This film is about two childhood friends who fight against the odds to be together.

""Rag Tag"" is a low budget film, so the visuals and sets are not as impressive as the blockbusters. Hence, it needs a good plot to captivate viewers. ""Rag Tag"" tells a touching story of undying love between two childhood friends. Even though they face societal pressure, criminal temptation, jealousy and non-acceptance, their love still manages to blossom into something beautiful. It is a beautiful story. The only problem I have with it is that it is a little too slow paced. If it was a little faster paced, it would have been an even more captivating film.",7,
"A Noble Directorial Debut

I discovered this on Tubi and I enjoyed it. It has its flaws but it doesn't take away from how great the film is

When Rag and Tag are separated at 12 and reconnect 10 years later, it seems as if there is no room for Rag in Tag's life though he knows what it means for him

I like how it portrayed the life of black people in the UK and a black gay man wrestling with what the world expects of him. We see two different men that complement and can't do without each other. Some of the visuals betray its low budget and quick edits do make us say:What? How'd they get here? One scene is anti climatic but still decent all things considered

The end is well done and crafted. The performances shine quite well, there was only one part in the beginning where I thought the boy should've been coached a little more in line delivery but that's really good considering I've seen other child actors grate on me

It's a great movie",7,
Art Immitating Life...or is it?,7,
"Only the first step, on the journey of a 1,000 miles

This film was reminiscent of Mel Brook's Life Stinks, which debuted in the early 90s. Indeed, it was a carbon copy beginning with its inauspicious circumstances to the ending's big reveal. Overall, it was entertaining but like most Nollywood films, there were no added layers of complexity; the good and bad guys are always too easily identifiable and thusly one dimensional.

One thing in particular I did NOT like about this movie was the role of the son. While it was necessary to show how naive he was in contrast to the greater realities of the less fortunate, they overshot the mark making him appear exceedingly slapstick and slow to understanding. Someone like that CANNOT be left in charge of anything!

The question I must ask is the following: Does this style of movie-making singularly define Nollywood films? And by that I mean, is this to be the preeminent face and form of Nollywood motion pictures? If so, then great! I am always happy to see my people shine regardless. But if not, then let's get more creative... seriously. 🤔",7,

"It's a feel-good movie, and a true story apparently. Only 20 people infected by one of the most dangerous viruses on Earth (for humans), in one of the Most populated cities on Earth. It is an interesting, yet underwhelming, movie because even though it is a true story, the filming was Very simple and simplistic. They took no leaps or bounds, no unique or stylistic effects, no high-Earth shots, or anything like this. It was a flat-facing still camera that shot people talking on beds and about the virus, sometimes reading newspapers and searching on Google, and it showed some denial from some, and the horrible death of others. It is remarkable that they did such a good job preventing Any such spread, but the camerawork and the overall theme really wasn't Movie-worthy, and rather a human experience. It is sad, but really only 20 people died, and even though this Is a tragedy, it could have been Much, Much worse, as this movie explains. Noone is unhappy it wasn't worse, but the movie suffered for being a small-set, no-risk melodrama that showed things that are pretty well known already. If you were a Nigerian, you would probably rate this 5 stars and buy it day-1 on 8k blueray, but as a random individual from anywhere else in the world a 4 stars is Maximum possible score for this film.",7,

I'm definitely going to be reviewing this movie on my Youtube channel ASAP.",7,
Pleasantly surprised,7,
"A huge step in Nigeria's Movie Industry

This movie captures the core of the relationship in any abusive marriage, it's values and the hypocrisy of pride. The cast were good. All portrayed their roles well enough, it was almost seamless. This says a lot for most Nigerian movies. They are usually rushed, quickly made, and not enough time is put into production. Desmond Elliot is a former well-known actor. He took to directing, and he shines through his works. He brings something to the table that most Nigerian directors are yet to grasp, and that is: Depth. Depth of the characters and depth of a story. Majid Michel (Thomas Dacosta), has a passion for acting, we can clearly see he loves acting, and it took him this long (5-8 years) to achieve a believable character in this movie, why? his looks aided his progress in the industry. While he may love to act, he's worked so hard to train a skill, and not a talent, he lacks the raw talent to act, but he has overcompensated with hard work. Too bad, in most of his movies, the overcompensation shows through with, cringe... over- acting. While West Africa has a long way to go in film, this movie depicts our progress thus far. The rest of the actors have the talent to act, but need a lot of refinement. You can see they are naturals but have hiccups with the rules of acting. However, the message is clear, and thought- provoking in aspects of marital bliss, belief, morality, love and spirituality. I am a Nigerian, living in Europe. In order for our movie industry to rub shoulders with the likes of Hollywood, our quantities of movies need to stop overshadowing the qualities of a good movie. It deserves a solid 7, with regards to the backdrop of the Nigerian movie industry. A win that may garner international acclaim.

There's room for improvement.",7,
"Timely...

A political thriller that's been long overdue out of Africa's Giant, Nigeria. Cinematography was crystal. Star-studded, the acting was top-notch and touched on issues bedevilling Nigeria as a nation. Also, released at a time prior to the 2019 General elections in Nigeria, 'If I Am President' will be a handmaid in enlightening and educating Nigerians, Africans, even the globe on the technicalities and ideologies holding sway in Nigeria - and why the office of the President of Nigeria (PON) is for those who do not play by the rules as is obtained in other 'sovereigns'.

However, one thing that 'If I Am President' delivers is hope. What can we do if not be hopeful? Perchance, it's the reason a synonym for Nigerians is 'resilience'.

I also liked the fact that in this movie, women are brought to the forefront - a woman, played by ace actress, Joke Silva, vies for the office of PON.",7,
Made me interested in learning more about Nigerian history. Any movie that makes me want to learn more gets at least 4 stars in my book.,7,
"I liked it a lot better than I tot I would. Especially the (rather timid, by Hollywood standard) sex scenes.

The comedy part of it was amazing, love it. The movie is a good one to me. I hope to see more from the same producers and writers.",7,

This movie is raw and a bit over the top some times but it is still better than a lot of the other skinhead movies that has been pumped out in the last 3 decades. There is a lot of mediocre acting here and there and some things made little to no sense for me but overall i did enjoy it for what it is. I would probably not watch it ever again but seeing it once is nice.,7,
"Do-mi-til-la!

Domitilla is a landmark film in the Nigerian home video industry. It kicked off the now-established trend of shooting films about 'single girls' and their (mis)adventures in big cities. The buzz for this film was remarkable, and the word 'Domitilla' was on everyone's lips. Everyone kept wondering what it meant, and it was cleverly used as a marketing gimmick, which made this film a blockbuster (a deserved one, though). At the time, 'Domitilla' became another word for prostitute or for a woman of loose morals.

Ann Njemanze, in the title role, gave a performance that made her an instant star. She made a few more films but doesn't seem to be interested in movie-making anymore, which is a pity. 'Domitilla' shows what she's capable of. Sandra Achums, a proved versatile actress, does well in this movie, and Zeb Ejiro, arguably Nigeria's most respected contemporary director (with the possible exception of Tade Ogidan) does excellently at the helm.

Domitilla is basically a story of what young girls get into in the quest to survive. Sometimes, they're fuelled by greed, sometimes by need, sometimes by poor company, sometimes by bad experiences ... but the bottom line is they end up doing things they shouldn't do. What are the consequences? Watch this film and find out.",7,

"Frankly speaking 'Coming From Insanity' is a second rate 'Scarface' with amateurish story-telling and Gabriel Afolayan played a second rate Tony Montana. However, we are happy to forgive because, despite its many shortcomings, 'Coming From Insanity' proved a sweet crime caper that pushed its audience to swoon, scream and fear. And with a bittersweet twist, it also broke their hearts. We were blessed to see 'Coming From Insanity' with a thirty something strong audience and we could literally feel their veins bursting with excitement as we were drawn closer and closer to the climax. These guys were sitting on the edge of their seats. Their eyes bulging, you could feel the pause in their breath, hearts pumping at full steam. Then silence. Relief. A chance to exhale. Followed very quickly by energetic applause - applause. Yet without warning, their joy was yanked violently away from them by the constraints and requirements of what we suspect to be an instance of ""dictated morality"": Bad Guys Must Not Win. So that when the lights came on, you should have seen their faces. Dejection all around. These people wanted to cry. Gaddamit! It was electric.",7,
"Fresh and highly entertaining, 'Who's The Boss' is the kind of Nollywood offering that brings sunshine and joy to our hearts at CinemaPointer because it shows without an iota of doubt that; Nigerians have got real film-making talent and plenty of it. 'Who's The Boss' is going to make you smile tonnes and scream too. But unfortunately, its end will leave you with a sullen face. And that is sad (See ""addendum"" for why). Now, while it's not perfect, 'Who's The Boss' has plenty to offer.

There's the brand-new looking production that blings all through. Yet, that's just a tiny bite off this sweetheart dish. All round; the acting is quite fabulous (even if weighed down here and there with the usual fakeries). The Colossus being Blossom Chukwujekwu -Good thing they let him off the leash- He's a delight you won't forget too soon. And seeing Funke Akindele in character without any ""Jenifa"" is the cherry on top. As ""Hauwa"", she is Yummily-Fierce. Just delicious!",7,
"Recommended!! Superbly entertaining, 'Kasanova' is a goal. Now, the story might not be completely new, but this movie is so crispy and shinny, it feels so fresh to Nollywood like a brand new toy. While it's not perfectly perfect, seeing this was most definitely a beautiful experience. Pounds and pounds of fun to be had here, 'Kasanova' is a promise fulfilled. A truly worthy offering. Go for it.",7,
"My introduction to Nigerian cinema & first film I’ve seen in Igbo. The performances are so natural with this absolutely unobtrusive camera that speaks the language of the independent domestic drama - the parts of the story unfamiliar to me, I’m able to catch up with. I’m swept up up in how we try to balance our own expectations of ourselves with the expectations others have of us. Amaka is caught between modernity and tradition, balancing her own small family and the crushing power of her extended family. To move forward in anything from this position is complicated and her response to a tragedy is almost unknowable.",7,
"Isoken is so beautiful 😍😍❤️
She looks gorgeous with her natural hair. Boooo to ideas of it not being feminine etc. I hate iiiit! She was stunning throughout!
Love the outfits. It started out showing a beautiful wedding ceremony too! It's kind of dark or grey-ish in a way, but then has these colours that pop on the screen!! The ending location was beautiful too, and I enjoyed the ending itself as well.
But who's this English guy 😂 White people in films in Africa and Asia.. the bar is low regarding the acting skills 💀 He was doing the most trying to fit in with Nigerian culture and pidgin etc 😂
I won't lie though, bad acting aside.. They were cute as hell in the kitchen 🥺🥰
Whilst it wasn't very deep and we didn't know enough about him from my perspective, it was really nice to see someone bringing out Isoken's personality. I enjoyed learning about her through their interactions. It was really nice to see her comfortable around a man who seemed interested in her.
So despite being shallow, it made the contrast between that and the other guy really stand out well. We see how there's a conflict on priorities for Isoken and what she wants. She has to think about what boxes need ticking the most for her. The other guy was handsome, they had romantic chemistry, he's rich as hell and all this. They're both good catches in their different ways, depending on how you value / what you want from relationships.

It made the end result understandable.

On a side note, the emphasis on men signing away their lives upon marriage is such a problem. You can feel the attitudes towards marriages via the way people talk about it differently for men and women.

They go through the pressure of marriage in Nigeria for women, as well as the general role of a woman in a marriage and things like that. We hear about how different women feel about the situation, in terms of how it affects them.

On a heavier topic, I liked the inclusion of the poor soul who suffers of a history of miscarriages too. I especially liked that it displayed fears that can come with new pregnancies as a result. It's something I think is important to represent in media, as it's very common yet underspoken of.

Overall, very fun and the best parts were honestly Isoken with her girl friends. It was so fun whenever they'd hang out or have heart-to-hearts etc. It was lovely seeing their friendship 🥰 It made me realise I definitely want to see more of that from my watches!

I was feeling down and this film lifted me up 😁❤️",7,

This is a movie that portrays how Nigerian society is bn controlled, this movie is an eye opener to how deep corruption has bn and how far people can go to cover their tracks, I honestly never believed that I was driving and watching this movie, filled with tears and fear for our future, Kemis Adetiba honestly just narrowed down the problem we are facing in the society, corruption starts with us as an individual, we need to personally decide to stop it from us even if it will cost us our loved ones, that's how we can eradicate all these nonsense. Kemi Adetiba just shed light on our daily lives can be controlled a million miles away, this awesome film maker didn't limit cost of production, put her soul and tear and resources to producing not only Emmy awards rated movie but an inspirational movie to all(both old and young). The only criticism I have is Kemi Adetiba, you did extremely too good to be a Nigerian production. You gave us faith, hope, longevity and desire to know that Nigeria hasn't lost it all, there's still something positive to hold on to. Thank you Kemi Adetiba, May others do to you that which you cannot do for yourself.",8,

"If you're a Nigerian . . .

In particular a Nigerian of a certain age (b/w 30-40) who lives elsewhere, but misses certain aspects of Nigeria, this is a really good film. Noted: that's a very narrow category. Look, Nollywood has produced some embarrassing nonsense, but The Wedding Party is something that is actually well-produced and directed. Also, the actors are good and/or appear to be having a good time. Is that a relatively low bar? Perhaps. But, again, consider the demographic and then see if you don't enjoy it.

"Good comic relief, good past time
I literally came of night shifts and settled with this movie. If you've not seen chief daddy 2, I kindly ask, what are you waiting for? It's incredible!

It flagged off with Rahama Saadus entry which was a good continuum from the former. Her entry gave a plot to the movie, ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"", ""If you really want something you'll find a way, If you don't, you'll find an excuse"". In between these, were different shades of awesomeness, from the comical character of Famzy, to the love story between Dammy & Ada, to the embittered mum who was about to lose it all, to the sisters who had no clue how to survive, to the lawyer who got all too engrossed with the family, to the fancy locations used (big fans of travel can pick a place or 2), to the colorful African attires, and of course the new casts who understood the assignment. It was good to hear Samuel Perry's voice.

I'd say each cast had a role you could align with, some upscale from the former movie, some downscale, albeit too much for one movie. There was some discontinuity in some scenes and roles, by and large forgivable, especially with good cinematography and camera angles. All in all, there was effort, and it's a good movie for the holidays and the start of the year. The soundtrack brought back some good music!

I had to create an imDb account just to write this review, because I noticed a lot of people saying most of the reviewers are paid, now that's a big lie! Paid by who? I guess the thousands of positive comments on her Instagram and Facebook page are paid too. I would say is the reverse, the bad reviewers here are paid to leave a bad review because who in their right mind would give this movie one 🌟. I'm not a big fan of Genevieve(movie producer, writer and director), but I must confess that this movie is spectacular, I'm surprised that she had the skills to put such work together. The production quality is superb, the story is authentic, best casting I have seen in a long time, I can go on and on. However, I understand if a foreigner leaves a bad a review because it's hard to figure out what's really going on if you are not an African. Nevertheless, my only criticism is that the movie should have been a bit longer, and maybe elaborate on the romance part(happily ever after kind of thing lol). In conclusion, it was a great movie that showcase our Nigerian culture, loved it!",8,

We are homegrown and proud. Most Nigerian films are rushed, and tacky with so many plot holes in the story but they're home to Nigerians, made by Nigerians, for Nigerians. This movie was made well.

"Nigeria's wars, from Biafra to Boko Haram
Biyi Bandele's ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" is the first Nigerian movie that I've seen, and it's an impressive one. The focus is the Igbo people's attempt to establish an independent country, called Biafra, sparking the Nigerian Civil War.

This speaks to a broader point about the wars that have plagued Africa's most populous country since its independence. Nigeria, like the rest of the African countries, is a creation of the colonizers. The people who lived there had only thought of themselves as members of their ethnic groups, not as members of a defined polity. Sure enough, the person who became the new leader favored his own ethnic group, which was certain to cause tensions with the others. In fact, it was often the colonizers who defined the ethnicities. For example, the Belgians labeled the Rwandans as Hutu and Tutsi, leading to the 1994 genocide there. The one saving grace of the Rwandan Genocide is that the Rwandan people no longer label each other by ethnicity, they only see each other as countrymen. This probably won't be as easy in the much larger Nigeria, which also suffers terrible corruption.

Anyway, I found this to be a very good movie. I haven't read the novel on which it's based, but I'd like to. I hope that Bandele turns out more movies.",8,
"Powerful film of a totally forgotten episode in history; not for the faint of heart

In 1960, Nigeria receives its independence from Britain. Twin sisters Olanna (Thandie Newton) and Kainene (Anika Noni Rose) are eager to celebrate their freedoms in new ways for African women. Olanna moves to a different city where she hooks up with a radical professor Odenigbo (Chiwetel Ejiofor); they are smitten. The prof has a loyal houseworker, Ugwu (John Boyega) who cooks and cleans. One day, Odenigbo's country mother shows up and creates trouble. First, she dislikes Olanna, calling her a witch, and she is aghast the Ugwu does the work. Naturally, the couple in question fights and goes separate ways for a short while. During this time, the prof sleeps with another woman who becomes pregnant. Amid sadness, Olanna forgives and eventually becomes the adopted mother to the child, a girl they call baby. Meanwhile, Kainene becomes the wife of a British immigrant, Richard (Joseph Mawle) and they, too, have trouble at times. More importantly, there are three main Tribes in Nigeria, with the twins Tribe, Igbo, always resented by the other two; perhaps, because they are Christian. Horrible violence against the Igbo breaks out in the North, with Olanna and Odenigbo fleeing for their lives to the Southeast, where most of the Igpo live. Many Igbos don't make it there; some are shot, others are killed with hatchets. Those that do decide to break away from Nigeria and form the new country of Biafra. But, because oil reserves are in Biafra, the other two Tribes blockade the country and food cannot get through. Will Olanna, Kainene, Odenigbo, Ugwu and others survive? This film has, first, a terrific cast, with Newton the main character. She is one of the most beautiful women in the world and gives a touching, heartfelt performance. Then, too, the landscape of Nigeria is shown here as lovely and colorful, giving the world a chance to appreciate its unknown beauty. Costumes, likewise, are just fantastic. But, alas, the violence, though brief, is horrific and those who choose to watch may want the fast forward button handy. Most importantly, the Igbo genocide is a totally forgotten event, with over two million of the Tribe perishing. All of those who view this film will want to seek out more information, read the book the film is based on, and spring to action to help the Igbo tribe even at this late date.",8,
"Love at war

Two couples survive the woes of war in Biafra. Film for TV but with a complicated history. The war is not shown to be very bloody.",8,
"A film set in Africa about Africans - a nice change.

I grew up in Britian where I knew many Nigerians, many of whom were doctors, lawyers and other professionals, and I remember the Nigerian Civil War over the secession of Biafra with the news media showing footage of starving people. I knew that Nigeria was one of the richest countries in Africa, with a large population, oil reserves, that the Igbo people of Nigeria were one of several ethnic groups and tended to be Christian, better educated and thus held most of the positions of power, to the resentment of the others, mainly the conservative Muslims in the North. I knew that the population of Nigeria was composed of many, many different tribes with different beliefs, and that as they did in the Middle East after WWI, the British had lumped them all together as one country regardless of ethnic and tribal differences. I could also name and locate several of the cities. Other than that, I had little idea of what Nigeria looks like, how the people live, what their homes are like. This film at least gave me some idea of what the country was like in the 60's, and for that reason I enjoyed seeing something fresh and different.

I found the film did not really address the civil war, the genocide, the famine and the religious strife other than barely touching on the subjects. Two million Igbo died in massacres and from starvation. We saw a young soldier killed at the airport after revealing that he was a Christian, but it was not made clear that their religion was one of the things held against the Igbo. The war continued for four years, and was partially prolonged by the western powers and Russia selling arms to both sides while Britain and Russia supported the Nigerian government. France supported Biafra. Once again a proxy war. the survivors continued to be persecuted after they returned to their homes, which had been taken over by others, as were their jobs. They were not reinstated nor were they compensated. Even their savings in banks were lost to devaluation and replacement of the currency, preventing them from starting over. 

I did have trouble keeping up with the characters and felt that some of the actors had very little to work with, Richard Churchill for example. Joseph Mawle is a fine actor, yet his character was as insipid as bowl of jello. The other actors were Nigerian, of Nigerian descent, or in the case of Thandi Newton, half Kenyan, which made for greater authenticity. Both Chiwetel Ejiofor and John Boyega are British born Nigerians.

For an adaptation of a book, a film has too short a time. As other reviewers have pointed out, it would have been better as a mini series, then the time spent on the twins love life and their fiances' infidelities would not have appeared to dominate the story. Perhaps the war was intended to be merely a background to the romantic angle, but I felt we needed to see more of the war and the sufferings of the Igbo people. But that is just my opinion. It was refreshing to see a film set in Africa which was about the African people of today rather than the great white hunter and the colonial era. I have not read the book, but I will do so after seeing this film.",8,
"Engrossing tale of family and war

I haven't read the book and had to decide which to do first, watch the movie or read. I feel now like a child with a present I haven't yet opened. Having seen a few youtube videos of Ms Adiche speaking I was intrigued to know more about her and when I found this film was available online I jumped at it. Other reviewers have covered most of the aspects of the movie as history and as it relates to the book, but having only heard Ms. Adiche speak about writing it and what she was trying to convey, mainly the humanity extant in all of us, I must say the movie moved me. I do not think Thandie Newton overacted or that her performance was flat, to me it had a kind of authenticity of blind devotion that impelled her character to somehow go with the flow even when life became impossible. This film also highlighted a reality that many of us grew up with in the daily news bulletins of our childhood and it is a tragedy that so much suffering has so easily been forgotten. I recommend this movie without reservation, the action moves quickly and if there is any criticism at all it is that some scenes lack connective tissue and I suspect one of the reviewers is spot on when they said that the book should have been made in to a TV series.",8,
"Not as Bad as reviewed.

Seriously, going to the readers review, I feel a lot of injustice is being done to this film. This is an adaptation hence you don't expect them to play all the parts as depicted in the book.

For a First time movie producer, Biyi Bandele has done a good job and should commended for it. I recommend that this movie should be watched by people who appreciates love in time of war.

The only cast I had a challenge with was Thandie Newton, who I believed overacted in a lot of scenes. Also we were unclear about the part of Captain Dutse(Hakeem Kae Kasim) in the film. Apart from those two points, all other aspects were spot on.",8,
"A noble effort despite certain aesthetic considerations
This movie is one that captured and then diminished my interest,but then captured it again. I have seen many movies that aim to depict the struggle of a people. Often they are tainted by Hollywood-style productions, which tend to dilute the emotional power they would otherwise have.Unfortunately, there was some of this here. However. Perhaps the majority of its viewers are fully aware of the tragic history of Nigeria in this era, including the formation of Biafra and the horrors in the aftermath of independence. For those who are, I would imagine that the telling of the story would be as gratefully appreciated as would food to the hungry. We in the west have not been graced with most of that history, because, unlike the Middle East and Eastern Europe, it has not been deemed relevant to our historical consciousness. So you might say that rating this movie could be guided by the need for bread, rather than the quest for bon-bons. I do not think the acting was bad, though it was not great. The level of trauma endured by those in the focus of the movie ( both the citizens generally and the main characters) puts in perspective what first world people have difficulty grasping, and lends insight into the reality that within every crisis there are still choices of conduct, and how these matter. I would have liked more linking of the role of the U.S. and Europe, specifically England, to the misfortunes of Nigeria- perhaps that was beyond the movie's scope. The footage in any case showed the cold, calculating mentality of the Royal Family as well as the English media in their involvement.The debate within political circles, and especially around the issue of 'the revolutionary', casts light on how misplaced optimism is so easily generated when change is desired. The ending, an update on the lives of the family,saved the viewers from the final insult of these lives being entirely frustrated by the debacle. Maybe that's a sentimental observation, but that's how it felt to me. I have seen Nigerian films that are nothing but soap operas, though even these have their merits, despite the protests of the high art crowd. I have seen movies such as 'Missing' by the noted director Costa-Gavras, that did not measurably exceed this in transcending Hollywood to tell an important story. So, you might say that this is a promising start for a new director. As an aside, and in conclusion, the name Nigeria comes up in a spell check, but not Biafra.",8,
"Stunning Finish

I started off a tad frustrated by the drawn out scenes and felt the first couple of episodes over indulged a bit in the excess time that comes with TV series hence the 8/10...However! The later episodes more than made up for the slow burn. In fact I don't remember much of the first episodes. All I can think of is the incredible plot twists and how the entire story came together into a stunning finale. Naija to the world y'all. I'm so proud 👏🏾",8,
"Kunle Afolayan delivers yet again.

As the title suggests, this is a Christmas themed movie for Nigerians.

The story is nothing we haven't seen before but its told from a Nigerian perspective, its funny, quirky and the dialogue is great when compared with others available in the Nigerian market.

Each member of cast is given adequate time to shine and shine they very well did! Production was good (obviously a Netflix Original so $$), pacing was great (can't believe I sat through a comedy of 2hrs without noticing), jokes were perfectly timed, all in all it was a great effort at a Christmas themed Naija movie.

I totally enjoyed the movie, would definitely recommend (to my Naija folks!).",8,

Maybe because of movie runtime of funds available for shooting, but I felt they should have built more on the leading actors Character arc like they did for his father in the first installation Albeit a very engaging story, it fell off towards the end, this ending was really questionable, maybe rumours of a sequel are true, if not that will be the only real blemish on this magnificent body of work",8,

Citation delivers on giving us a logical representation of what happens in the real world to a large percentage of the youth, particularly students, and more particularly those of the female gender.

It portrays the flaws in the educational system, the power of the judicial system, the strength in a positive united voice and agenda, and the fault in our so-called stars. It's narrative sequence and epic flashbacks deserve honorable mentions as they draw us deep into realms unfamiliar and virtually unseen to the distant eye.

"Plot seems boring at first but brilliant movie overall

I would say Road to yesterday is your typical 'Genevieve' movie. Slow- paced, good acting and drama filled. The movie starts out with an obvious quarrel between a couple (played by Genevieve Nnaji & Oris Erhuero) which seemed normal at first, but however dragged on for the better part of the movie (boring at some points). You are left in the dark curious about the cause of the quarrel but this is revealed bit by bit through constant flashbacks, eventually all is left bare and the plot kicks in. Recommended if you are not going to the theater expecting an endless action plot, but rather mature drama. Suitable characters, good plot and overall an interesting movie.",8,
"Searching for a soundtrack & review

There'se a soundtrack at the end of the movie. On the background. It contains no words, it's more a melody. I'm trying to find the name of it.

Beside that, great movie, really slow paced. Acting is realistic. No absurb emotions or anything like that. The conversations, the choosen words, the evens, the chemistry. It looks natural like you're watching a real situation. There's alot of silent moments and stuff like that. So you either like this type of movies, or you don't",8,

This is a really disturbing story. I feel so sad for Enitan, I cannot possibly imagine what he went through in his childhood. His transformation is remarkable.

"Raw & Brutal Skinhead-themed Film..

Those negative reviews for this movie are a joke. People need to leave their personal feelings and viewpoints out of it when they are reviewing a movie. And those petty enough to call the director out as a ""liar,"" claiming ""this never happened"" nonsense is equally ridiculous; it's a movie, created to entertain and or educate. Who cares if it's fact or fiction? The people with this complaint probably believe that Hollywood trash like ""Pearl Harbor"" is not mostly fiction. On to the technical aspects of this movie, (something that actually matters), ""Farming"" is a beautifully, artfully shot slice of eye candy, which is ironic considering the grotesquely ugly themes of this difficult movie. Kate Beckinsale is utterly believable as the Cockney speaking Londoner who brings extra cash into the house by raising the Nigerian children left in her care by parents who don't have the means to raise them. Growing up in a completely White surrounding, where most everyone seems to be at least a little racist, and sometimes intensely racist against the people who's skin color is the same as young Enitan, the Nigerian boy, thrust into this alien world where everyone looks different from him. This film is basically about self identity, and how our surroundings and upbringing shape the person we become, and how our minds work. So although Enitan is Black, he grows up like his peers, despising people with black skin. What an insane and unique theme for a film..FINALLY something different. When Enitan joins up with the skinhead gang who had been torturing him, things become quite intense indeed. He calls himself Andy and shaves off his offending afro, so desperate to be among the people he relates to, even as they hate him and abuse him to no end. Movies about skinhead culture are rare, maybe one appears every 10 years or so. This one stands out with the best of them, including ""This Is England,"" ""Romper Stomper,"" and is especially similar in tone to ""Made In Britain"" with Tim Roth. Also worthy of praise is the acting in ""Farming,"" as everyone turns in intensely believable performances. John Dagleish gives an especially ferocious performance as 'Levi,' the leader of the Tilbury skinheads, and Damson Idris' portrayal of the tortured, self loathing Enitan is brave and faultless. This movie is destined for cult status as it finds it's right audience. Those pathetic 1 star reviews prove that this film reached the wrong audience. Oh well, ""Blade Runner"" was also a flop when it first came out, so only time will tell. I recommend ""Farming"" to fans of edgy cinema that doesn't shy away from uncomfortable scenarios, and also to those interested in the Skinhead youth culture of the 70's and 80's. Similar to ""The Krays"" and ""Legend,"" thankfully this is also a British production, so it manages to avoid the sappy, moralizing and PC garbage that Hollywood feels the need to inject into it's productions.",8,

I'm writing this as a white male, who hasn't experienced overt privilege in this country, other than what a white-biased society has permitted. I don't feel shame for this, as I also grew up as a minority, fighting for basic human rights.

"Powerful Movie asking and exposing the world medical system as satanic

The only critique I would give is that the cast line up is decent and good. The camera or quality of cameras used is evident in sound, visuals and the balance of voice volume with actions are evident. The Film is clearly telling a story. Over all the film could use warmth and gloss. This may be due to either lack of experience on directors part or the equipment and mastering of the film needed more time and finesse including equipment quality and standard. Still worth while to support African movies and the craft of african actors. Africa has a little distance to go in cinematography compared to India. This movie is important and exposes the darkness and maligned behaviour of the world medical system and pharmaceutical companies. Very powerful movie and ask the questions that need to be asked. Why would the medical system knowingly prevent doctors who can truly cure sicknesses from doing so? Greed , money, manipulation and control of humans. It is simply satanic and devilish at its cores.",8,
"A Simple Story But Well Executed

After this failed attempted she swears herself off dating men her friends set her up with however ends up turning to them in desperation after needed a date for a work Valentines Ball.

I love love loooooove Majid and Genny together. They have amazing chemistry and make a wholly believable couple. Susan Peters is so underrated. I love watching her, especially in comic roles like this one. I heard her once referred to as a Nigerian Paris Hilton but I must say that she holds more value for me than a Paris Hilton. Bishop Imoh was great, he always brings the comedy. Omoni and Nse were great as the meddling girlfriends. The movie was well casted.

In conclusion I would recommend the movie. It was solidly good and well worth watching, however I was a little disappointed because it the storyline was so ordinary and nothing different to what we have seen countless times before. I think that perhaps I was expecting too much, and it just didn't live up to the hype, however the picture quality and sound were excellent, acting was great and in general the movie was well executed.",8,

"Woefully underrated....and it deserves to be seen.

""Namaste Wahala"" is a very good film....and I wonder WHY it has a paltry rating of only 5.1 on IMDB. I just do not understand it. I have my theories...but don't want to get into conjecture. What I do know is that it's a lovely film...one that really hit me emotionally...and it's DEFINITELY a film to watch with a box of Kleenex nearby.

The story is filmed in Nigeria and it's about a very beautiful couple that you are bound to like. But there is a major obstacle in their way. Didi (Ini Dima Okojie) is Nigerian and Raj (Ruslaan Mumtaz) is Indian...and the film is about the uphill battle they both face with their parents. In both cases, the parents simply don't want their children marrying someone who isn't one of 'their people'.

In addition to this plot, there's a shocking subplot involving a friend of Didi who is assaulted by a brute of a man. And, since Didi is a lawyer, she's representing her friend in a lawsuit against the jerk. But, it turns out, her father and his law firm are representing the brutal jerk! This, combined with the ethnic/racial differences make life tough for Didi...as well as Raj.

As I watched the film, I think it was written well because the problems the couple face are things that can be blamed on everyone involved. Neither Raj nor Didi prepared their families for the prospect of a new in-law of a totally different background. And, as for the parents, it's obvious that they need to learn to look beyond race and ethinicity...and their own prejudices. It also seems to say that it's best to trust your beloved family...as in the end, they will usually do the right thing....so don't give up.

All in all, it's a very sweet and interesting film...one that didn't seem too heavy-handed or obvious...and one I recommend strongly. It's a good romance but it has plenty for everyone...if they give it a chance.",8,
"Charming and unusual in its cultural mix

I have never seen a Nigerian-Indian rom-com. There is Nollywood (Nigerian Hollywood) and Bollywood (Bombay Hollywood) and this movie is a hybrid mashup of the two. Yes, it is a bit corny. Yes basically it is formulaic. Yes, the acting is a bit outdated. But the charm is seeing the clash of two cultures that one never sees being contrasted in the movies in an engaging story. The rom-com formula is there, but the comic clashes are unique. They kept me laughing throughout. This is the world as it is becoming, folks. And it is refreshing and charming to see it. I was thoroughly delighted to see this cross-cultural confection. Brava to the director (who also plays a pivotal role in the movie). Above all it made me want to visit Lagos. This is a preview of a world I want to live in. If Nigerians and Indians can overcome their cultural differences, so can we all.",8,

"Profoundly sad...

""Mother of George"" is a film with a strong and interesting cross-cultural message. It's also a film that would probably be seen as a feminist movie--though it is something that can be enjoyed, or at least appreciated, by all.

The film begins with a wedding--and what a beautiful wedding it is. The guests are all Nigerian Americans and they are dressed in their finest and most color clothing. During the course of the wedding (which takes up a significant part of the film), the new wife, Nike (Danai Gurira) is told again and again how important it is that she have a baby boy as soon as possible. Culturally, there is a HUGE amount of pressure on her--and it's pretty obvious at this point that Nike will have difficulty conceiving. This is made so much worse by her mother-in-law--a very traditional African mother who insists that Nike either become pregnant or her son find another wife! While Ayo (Isaach De Bankolé) is not about to get another wife, he also is bound by masculine expectations and he forbids his wife to get infertility testing and he adamantly refuses to have himself tested. What is poor Nike to do? Well, when she listens to her mother-in-law's plan, it throws her for a loop. 

This film has a lot to say. Yet, interestingly, it DIDN'T have a lot of dialog and managed to say a lot without words. Its theme of women as baby machines and their devaluation by societies is hard-hitting and sad. Equally sad is its way that men are trapped by their machismo. There's a lot to this film--and one that, in some ways, cuts across all cultures. Well worth seeing.",8,

Well crafted, highly personal story told with superb acting

Adenike and Ayodele, a Nigerian couple living in Brooklyn, are having trouble conceiving a child - a problem that defies cultural expectations and leads Adenike to make a shocking decision that could either save or destroy her family.

I saw this movie last night and it still resonates powerfully with me a day later. The story of a Nigerian immigrant newlywed couple and their travails in getting pregnant, there are five things that set that distinguish this film and make it so worth watching: - The lead performances are exceptional. The Cesar winning actor Issach De Bankolé is always good and his wife, played by American-Zimbabwean Danai Gurira, is pitch perfect as a tradition-bound young woman struggling to balance custom and familial obligation with a new country/culture and her own budding ambitions.

The pacing of the film is mannered and deliberative, giving the audience a chance to take in the consuming nature of the couple's struggle to have a baby. More European than Hollywood in its timing, the pacing works especially as an antidote to the rapid paced Nollywood films covering similar ground.


The use of color in the film, both through cinematography and wardrobe, is both stunning and meaningful. The colors correspond to the Orishas or Youban Gods that slyly provide a subtext and foreshadowing of plot that may be unfamiliar to American audiences, but clever and refreshing to any who have been exposed to the Afro-Caribbean religions for which they are central. Just as Orisha symbols has long been integrated into Catholicism and mainstream culture in places like the Dominican Republic and Cuba (for example, it's the bases of the colorful costumes used by showcases at Havana's Tropicana -- the archetype and bases for Las Vegas), they are hidden in plain sight in this film. It's a wonderful added dimension to the film.


The characters are beautifully realized. The husband's mother, brother, and brother's girl friend are all complicit in the wife's struggles to have a child and each have their own complex character strengths and flaws. While the dialogue is a bit fallow in places, the characters themselves are not.


The sexuality of the film was portrayed in capturing a range of emotions -- from martial obligation, to lust and true love. Rarely do we get to see such a range in a film, and rarer still is it captured in a movie by and about Black characters.

It is an interesting first feature directorial debut with reasonably good acting, but a messy screenplay that tries to do too much at the same time. It tries to deal with a young Nigerian immigrant's American Dream, his confrontation with racial prejudice, his dysfunctional immigrant family with its own buried secrets, a cross- racial romantic relationship and his growing drug addiction. The screenplay just feels messy with too many subplots and too much happening to allow the stories and characters to fully develop. It is clearly closely related to the director's own family experience as a Nigerian- American immigrant. It is an interesting story and enjoyable although it doesn't feel like it is quite complete in its attempt to cover too much ground in to little space. Even the title is not clearly explained to the audience. The director said it means ""better"" and that its about the aspirational experience of the immigrant",8,

"Broke the mould

I've watched a lot of Nigerian films. The quality can vary in terms of storyline, cinematography, actual acting, sound quality. This film broke the mould in all those respects. It's also a harsh intro to the forces which lead to human trafficking, modern slavery and all the horrors of modern W Africa and elsewhere that can't be ignored There is a caveat....there are some scenes which I had to skip through.But it's great to see 'Nollywood' at its best I retract that. This isn't 'Nollywood'. It's world cinema from W Africa and deserves recognition for being up there with some of the best films of the year worldwide from anywhere.",8,

"Carries a rare sense of pensive cognizance and further provokes reflection on the part of its target audience.
deladogla6 October 2015
Kunle Afolayan's October 1 serves us poignant paradox of how far we have come but, tellingly, how rooted we are to the murky leech infested waters of colonialism of whence. Afolayan's film uses a latter-day colonial setting as a canvas for a mystery of violence that engulfs a small town in the month preceding the end of British occupation.

The script by Tunde Babalola is a tremendous novelty as much as it is an indictment. This is the most poignant and only Pan-African film I've seen make rounds. It is gushing with the detail and art design of whence from the quaint highlife tunes to 60s apparel and the chilling totems of British occupation. We find haughty British officials, the sharp contrast of the Union Jack flying over the green environs and indigenes along with the prominent standing of the Queen some thousand miles away from Buckingham. Never has the seemingly innocuous portrait of Queen Elizabeth conveyed such weight filmed with overbearing intimidation. A chunk of the setting bears eerily similarity to contemporary society. On the one hand we recognize the ostensive timelessness of how culture is projected by song, dance, beliefs etc. On the other hand we recognise a culture of education that remains steadfast to the neglect and dysfunction of pre-independence. The only thing that has changed is the national anthem.

There is a middle ground, an ambivalence, found in the people we encounter with regards to points of communication, religion and identity. The film is well aware of this ambivalence and the fact of it being the only real change brought on by colonial occupation and subsequent liberation to mostly negative consequences. The central setting of Akote typifies this in that it is a trading post and the meeting points of culture, ethnicity, religion etc. I say mostly negative but we are treated to scenes in a bar owned by an albino serving men and women, northerners and southerners, Igbo and Yoruba. This diversity goes to serve as a conduit of tension as the film unravels fuelling a sense of cynicism brought on by one of the film's characters in response to Nigeria's independence. Afolayan isn't as subtle as he could be in this regard getting a little too preachy but a chilling sense of poignancy lingers. Hindsight is crystal – almost a crystal ball taking into consideration the pathology left behind by the bane of Western occupation.

I have rambled on about Afolayan's world building but there is a thread here: Police inspector Danladi Waziri (Sadiq Daba) is dispatched to Akote in Western Nigeria to investigate a couple of murders by his British superior (Nick Rhys). Independence is a month away and the British would rather no major cases remain on file when the baton is passed. Virgin ladies are being raped, strangled and left with peculiar markings which leads to suspicions of a serial killer in this small rural community. More bodies drop confirming this assessment. The film is well plotted like a conventional whodunit. Waziri arrives in Akote, asks a lot of questions and does some investigating with the local Sergeant Sunday Afonja (Kayode Aderupoko) at his side. The camera gets to look suspiciously at people and throw some red herrings our way but the film shows its hand towards the final act and positions itself as an exploration of the rot at the crux of the murders.

The detail may have suggested an overly serious tone but affairs here almost mirror the jolly simplicity of life on the country side. I was reminded of Fargo. There are no cool looking inspectors trying crack the case. Waziri doesn't carry an intellectual swagger with a smoking pipe in hand. He sports the standard baggy uniform (with shorts) over his old skinny frail body and rides around on a ""buzanga Volvo"". Much like the heavily pregnant Marge Gunderson in Fargo, don't let the surface get in the way. Waziri knows his police work. He comes to Akote with a reputation of closing a high profile murder involving a British man, of course – I did say high profile. Daba plays Waziri well managing to project some authority through this seemingly unassuming persona. A look into Waziri's eyes and we can tell he's been around the block. We can also sense some weariness and guilt. Perhaps Afolyan uses him to project a spirit of neo-colonialism.

Waziri doesn't speak the native tongue hear relies on interpretation from Afonja – almost like a British man. He is all about due process willing to overstep sacred instructions and culture of this society in the name of the law. There is subtle but disquieting naiveté at work in his character. The most excruciating moment sees him impose authority on a restless mob in the name of the Queen with Nigeria all but independent. More depth can be found in the character of Prince Aderopo played by the smooth Demola Adedoyin (who probably leads this film under a lesser director). He is always clad in white as the film plays out. His initial scenes have him returning as Akote's first ever graduate of the full western education system. Later on he dances to (what sounded like) western music playing on his gramophone. The excitement of Independence beckons but Aderopo looks to more time in the West pursuing a Master's degree and he doesn't have nice things to say about Nigeria's future as a sovereign state.

Whilst October 1 is gushing with rich detail it is not without its flaws. The film starts to lag in the final act as the testing running time becomes apparent. Redundant flashbacks and exposition feature and a little more confidence in the audience would not have been remiss. There is still a tremendous amount to behold – character depth, nuance and subtext oozing out of the script, stellar cinematic DP work and Afolayan's strong vision.",8,
"good movie

October 1 makes an attempt at telling Nigeria's story before her independence while inculcating another suspense filled story that captures the viewers' attention till the very end. This thriller is set in the colonial times and was well executed by the use of great costuming, antique props such as cars used in that era and household items like television sets and all sorts. Apart from exploring the theme independence, it also sheds light on topics including homosexuality, tribalism and illiteracy. The casting is the best I have seen so far in ""Nollywood"". It is an amalgamation of old and new faces with well-developed skill-set. It features veterans like Sadiq Daba and Kayode Aderupoko who are well known prolific actors in Nigeria. The scripting 'of the movie could have been better as it affected the dialogue, the use of flashback technique is not well executed as one could not really tell what was going on without putting much thought into it. A lot of thought was put into production as the picture is top quality and the post production is detailed, the music used also helps to depict the time frame portrayed in this movie. I don't want to give out any spoilers but i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in having surface knowledge about Nigeria before its independence",8,
"Its not perfect but it was a nice surprise

I didn't find the movie perfect, specially with acting and production but, as my expectations were low, I ended up enjoying this movie.",8,
"pretty good

It felt semi messy at times and was very overdramatized but I really enjoyed watching it anyway",8,
"Season 2

I loved Season 1 and I could hardly wait for Season 2. I realize we are in a Covid Pandemic and things are not as they were. I love all the characters and actors. I was a bit disappointed in the storylines but I figured it had something to do with Covid. I am hoping there will be a Season 3 because Season 2 was way way too short. I watched the whole season in one day. Even though I feel Season 2 did not stand up to Season 1 I am still looking forward to a Season 3 and hope it will be more than 6 episodes. I look forward to Maliq and Nekka's relationship. Captain needs to get out of jail. Stella needs to tell the sisters who what and whatever. What's gonna happen to the Son? And what happened to his friend that took the rap for him hitting and killing the person. Teger and Remi need to get it together. Oooh ""low hanging fruit""? That was a low blow. And what is Remi doing with Mike? I like all the characters. So hopefully you'll keep bringing on the new Series.",8,
"Very well written & performed.

This was quite an original take on the common subject of infidelity. The plot was very well thought out; interesting and the pacing kept me engaged from the very beginning. It would throw me off from any predictability in fairly creative ways at well spaced out intervals throughout its nice length and the acting was of a decent standard from everyone too. The ending sealed this movie off really nicely and the moral lessons are sound.

On another note, I am so impressed by Nollywood movies nowadays. The storytelling and themes in general are leading the way for ""black movies"" because they have simply advanced way past the obvious notion that the cast or setting is black-orientated and instead they just focus more on everyday life without those patronising caricatures. So refreshing!

Quick note the editor: Less warp stabiliser.",8,
"Nice Movie

Can it be better. Hell yeah But as one of the pioneer sci-fi movies, it was good. The messaging was apt & the lapses in some scenes understable per the end of the movie. It's cool.

Really didn't know what to expect.

Would watch more stuff in this genre from Naija.",8,
"Held my attention

Good show, held your attention, great story line, loved the mystery and drama as well as some comedy. Loved the story line of the Christian life on campus. Hopefully, there's a season 2.

Such a brilliant story line. Enjoyed every bit of it It was a beautiful showcase of Northern Nigeria.",8,
"A lovely movie to see.

Yeaa, strain is indeed a lovely movie. I enjoyed it, it brought tear to my eyes towards the end maybe cos I'm AS and the dude I loved too is AS. So we had to call it a quit.

I could really relate to it because, I saw the picture of what would happen if I go ahead with the relationship.

However, the only challenge for me despite the lovely story line was the actors that played the parental role, for God sake, they didn't put life to the act at allllll.

The beards was off for me, cos there wasn't a need for it, it looked fake. The mother didn't put emotions as well, if Zainab Balogun had played that role, dammit, would have been the bomb. Though, she could have tried to be better.

Also, the part that really got me laughing hard was when she went to apologize to her daughter. The way she said 'I'm sorry' and ran away was was epic. 🤣🤣🤣 Typical Nigerian mothers, having difficulties saying sorry.

The Doctor played a beautiful role, not the regular we are made to watch.

Asides all these, I enjoyed the movie, rating it 8/10 that's why I added it to my list for friends weekend watch.",8,
"Really great for women (and men too)
In a world where women are pressured to look better than they are, and live above their means, this show serves as a great tool of financial education to guide them into sensible organisation of their finances and the benefits of delayed gratification. Oh, and it's entertaining too! Fantastic acting!

I don't know what's with the music production though, seems like the same songs were on repeat in every episode.",8,
"flawed but enjoyable (and important)

A faithful adaptation of one of the novels that began modern Hausa literature in the colonial period, by the future Prime Minister of Nigeria, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. The acting is a bit stilted at times, and the director betrays his training in documentaries. But Hausa (or ""Haoussa"" as they spell it in most of the French speaking countries) is the largest language in Africa south of the Sahara, and if you are at all curious to see a Hausa movie, or real African film, this is one to see.

When I saw it in the States with a friend we watched a long dialogue at the beginning, followed by subtitles which translated the exchange with two words: ""Hello."" and ""Hello.""

My friend leaned over and whispered ""What did they say?""

""That was it."" I explained ""That was 'hello' in Hausa.""

It may not always make sense to you, but to the Hausa this movie was a hit, and remains a classic, ""must see"" Hausa film.",8,

This was a very well acted Nollywood film. My experience with previous films from Africa that I've watched haven't been acted well.

I thought it was a traditional action movie. But it has a very good story with meaningful inspiration. It uncovers the competition between weapons and water in Africa.,8,
"A great film; and was a huge success at the time of release.Films like Glamour Girls put the Nigerian film industry on the map; Nollywood owes this film a lot. The film highlights the fact that life is difficult in Nigeria resulting in a subculture that is replete with corruption and intrigue. There is a subclass of people that thrive on fraud and swindling the unsuspecting victim. The message is clear. Keep your wits about you. Do not be too trusting in people because the quest for money, motivates mischief! Raymond Johnson is not mentioned in the cast; yet he did a fine job portraying Alex. He really has presence and was as smooth as caramel in his portrayal of the deceptive Alex. It is tragic that he is late for he would have been one of the great actors. As for Tony Nworah's review, he was obviously watching a different film!",8,

The movie was great until the last 20 minutes, it's just went armature. Was strong until they had to fill in too much details just before the end and then not even end the story.",8,
"Hits the right note

Nollywood can be hit and miss sometimes but Seven is definitely a hit. You might get good editing, bad script or great story terrible cinematography that doesn't happen here. Seven has a reality that most Nollywood movies lack. The language is Street, the cast stellar, cinematography and editing is on point. It also has a great plot. Best of all it puts Ajegunle on the map.",8,
"They took a risk but it was worth it

They took a risk but the execution from production to acting was very well done. Really chuffed to see a Nigerian film that made such a genre of action relatable to Nigerian theme and story line. Well done and definitely worth the watch.",8,
"Don't expect Hollywood style cinematography but...

Nimbe is an enjoyable film even though we've witnessed this story in film many times before. However this is the version by Nigerian film makers. The action and acting is of Latin-American tele novela styly and the language was slightly jarring for me at first but was quickly overcome by the presence of believable characters, although the mother has some odd lines and does occasion act eccentric but this may be a Nigerian trait. All in all I really enjoyed and would recommend to any lover of non English language film.",8,

"The Nigeria people.
This Show was a 7 episode show that was made in 2018 and was filmed in Nigeria. ""The Journey of The African Colony""got me thinking so much about people and how deep issues are compared to what we just see on just the surface. The 7 episode show went through the backstory of the African people and it really delves into the stories no one hears about and the unsung heroes that lead the Nigerian people to finding their independence. So hearing all these stories led me to come to the conclusion that there are so many issues and conflicts people go through, especially the people of Nigeria, so it made me realize that we shouldn't automatically assume the population problem and the resource management problem is entirely their fault. If you take a good look at the Nigerian peoples history you will notice that years and years ago that they were running from the British, Spaniards and many other white men. So most of these Africans ended up in Nigeria and Nigeria was named the ""safe place"" for these african people to go. There weren't any other options other than Nigeria African, so keeping that in mind we could come to the conclusion that the African people were fleeing from enslavement and Nigeria was the best option for people to go. Then once Nigeria filled up, we are seeing the repercussions of that now, the population problem we see now is creating a domino effect, we are seeing people not having enough homes, not enough resources in general. I think the issue Nigeria is having is not nearly their fault but an unfortunate term of events accrued that gave them no choice.",8,

Nolywoody producing fantastic works, which seemed to be just another sugar water romance a la ""Romeo and Juliet"", gained tragic police contours, in the feud between different families (tribes), but not necessarily rivals, until the lovers marry, making a family war, beautiful film, sad, tragic, with offenses between families and curses, traditions, religions, beliefs, separating young people in love (or uniting them for eternity)...

"Farming is based upon writer / director Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's life as a young Nigerian boy who was fostered to a white working class British family in the 1980's. This was something that occurred frequently from the 1960's - 1980's and became known as farming. The film's main focus is on identity and how this young boy grew up confused and alone with a verbally abusive and casually racist white British mother and traditional conservative Nigerian parents who he only saw every few years. He struggled to accept who he was, forming a strong desire to be white and eventually fell in with a group of abusive and violent skinheads, completely losing his way until tragic and violent events eventually lead him back to the right path and accepting his own identity. I thought this was excellent. Damon Idris is superb in the lead role as someone who is filled with so much hate for himself and others who share his cultural identity yet also hates the new group that have formed around him. It's tense, harrowing and a powerful film and my heart breaks for any children that were put through this system because it must have been a real struggle adjusting to life in Nigeria after spending time growing up on the streets with the white British working class .

",8,
"Akinnuoye-Agbaje's directorial debut is a troubling coming-of-age story based upon the directors own experiences as a 'farmed out' Nigerian child in the UK during a period of surging xenophobia in the wake of the Windrush generations arrival. The look and feel of the films early moments present a setting and characters so raw and realistic that one could only capture from having experienced them. The pacing of the film in many ways reflects this. At times seeming to take on an almost frantic pace which is meaningful in a way that captures the effect of somebody recalling their life story - made up of the important details and traumatic moments - though occasionally making it difficult to capture and appreciate the passage of time bordering on surreal. The supporting characters similarly are raw and identifiable foils though lacking in the depth required to be whole characters beyond their interactions with the film's lead. Furthermore the film does little to address or contextualize its setting, deliberately choosing to focus on the internal struggles of it's central character. Despite this the films central character is compelling enough to keep the viewer engaged solely in his development throughout the film. Overall Farming is an impressive directorial debut that tackles issues of dual identity and self-hatred in a manner that leaves plenty unsaid but provides a bitter and frequently heartbreaking account of an individuals struggle for meaning and identity. There is so much to be admired about this film which presents an often overlooked period in British history, the importance of such a personal topic deserving of a greater run-time than the films mere 107 minutes.",8,

While Shaffy Bello stands out majestically; the acting here is generally, all round; Perfect! Honestly, the flawlessness of this flick is indescribable. Even the funny parts feel so real, they are life-like funny. So funny, you will be stumping your feet like you need to run out of your seat.

Yet, 'Mama Drama' is not a comedy. Neither does it pretend to be one. No. Not at all. 'Mama Drama' is drama in its purest sense. It is cogent, potent, thick and concentrated. Absolutely Amazing. Not to be missed.",8,
"Recommend, strictly for Baba Suwe's crowd. Because; flamboyantly nonsensical, 'Sugar Rush' is a ""Baba Suwe"" feem. There's simply no art to it - The comedy it offers is terribly predictable and sorely obvious. Lacking in any subtlety or thoughtfulness, this movie was not made for the intellectual viewer. It was made for the mob; that Baba Suwe crowd. 'Sugar Rush' was crafted specifically to please them. Only them. And it worked. It worked spectacularly:

The hall was packed. And from start to finish, this crowd laughed their heads off. From minute to minute, explosions of laughter filled the room. People, violently animated by punchlines; literally tore out of their seats and jerked back furiously, time and time again, seemingly having lost control of their bodies. Visibly drunk with incessant laughter, they laughed hard and coughed out even louder -  'Sugar Rush' wouldn't give them a moment's rest to catch their breaths.

So loud and continuous was the laughter, you could feel the atmosphere vibrating with the fire of their satisfaction. It was amazing to watch. For these people, 'Sugar Rush' was exactly that; A Rush of Sugar. And they loved it beyond description. We can well testify to that. Nevertheless, we hated it. Every single second of it. 'Sugar Rush' was a celebration of The Ridiculous. And it was utterly foolish.

"Running for only a paltry sixty six minutes, 'The Delivery Boy' is the quintessential definition of ""Quality over Quantity"". This movie is one of the best movies we have seen come out of ""Young"" Nollywood. The makers had the good sense to match technical quality with a good story that is simple, yet very engaging and avoids being overly predictable like its lazy counterparts ""Young"" Nollywood is wont to churn out.

We had fun seeing this today, and so did the miniscule audience we were blessed to see it with. We all left the hall with zero regrets. And we are sure you will too. While 'The Delivery Boy' is far from being perfec, we can confidently tell you that; if there ever was a Nollywood movie that deserved your support by paying to see it, 'The Delivery Boy' is the one. It is incredibly bold and progressive. Applaudable material. Go for it!",8,
" 'Jumbled' is highly entertaining and exceptionally enjoyable. You will hate the characters, then you will love them, then hate them and love them again.

And not too long after that, your ""Awww"" quickly turns to ""Hehn? My God!"" Fantastic movie. Not perfect. But fantastic all the same.",8,

"Quality is the hallmark of this movie. 'Lionheart' screams ""Quality! Quality! Quality!"" The production is a hundred. Everything just shinny and crispy. Yet the acting is even better than the production. But that's not so much a surprise, as 'Lionheart' boasts Kanayo O. Kanayo and Pete Edochie, two Nollywood Legends, rarely seen in cinema.

"Finally a great Nigerian film. For years I’ve been hoping that Nigeria would produce a really great film, and that’s where the Esiri brothers come in. A pair of really promising filmmakers that have quite a bit of Ken Loach in their DNA, which is never a bad thing.

Eyimofe is about struggle, and trying to escape from difficult circumstances for a better life in Europe. We follow two stories, one about a middle-aged man, and one about a young woman. Both go through real hardship with some good writing, and acting for a film from Nigeria. I’m really happy that Nigerian films are starting to use the wealth of great actors who live in other countries, or have Nigerian heritage to make great socio-realist cinema.

The framing throughout the film is really great and you can really see it was shot on film. I’m expecting great things going forward from this filmmaking duo, and I sincerely hope we see more filmmakers from Nigeria making films such as these.",8,
"In spite of the less than satisfactory parts of Ayinla, the movie, it is an excellent work of art, and Lateef Adedimeji’s less than brilliant performance did not take away from the overall satisfaction derivable. It is beautiful to see Tunde Kelani and Kunle Afolayan work together again, after Saworo Ide and Agogo Eewo. ",8,
"A Naija Christmas takes us from the idyllic Ikoyi, where everything is calm and high-class, to the bubbling Mushin, where you can be obtained if you don’t stand well. You see the beauty of Lagos at night, when it is well lit. You feel the real Naija Christmas spirit, and you want to share it with others.",8,
"It is beautiful to see Sam Dede on our screens again, and to see he is still a master of his craft, giving us a stellar performance. Where there is Stella Damasus, you can be sure to see some genuine tears, with emotional scenes, and she seems ageless. I have always loved Gabriel Afolayan, he is truly dedicated to his craft, and he does not disappoint in Gone. The chemistry between him and Bimbo Ademoye as siblings is so beautiful to see, you would think they are true life siblings. ",8,
this movie is a good offering in the genre.  ,8,
"76 is an excellent piece of artwork. The quality of the work shows the effect of military consultation that was done, and it demonstrates how Nollywood stands to benefit from consulting professionals in portraying their fields and activities, to give the audience the right type of authentic experience.",8,
"The onscreen chemistry between Ramsey and Rita is a testament to their skills and legendary status in Nollywood. It is also lovely to see Chidi Mokeme, who we think has been away for too long. 
",8,
"The movie authentically gives us the feel of the eighties, up to how parties were organized, the talk about bleaching, the clothes, and the generous use of damask and adire. ",8,
"it is a great movie from someone whom we know to be a great storyteller. Gold Statue may not be one of Tade Ogidan’s best works, but it ranks high up there",8,
"Gabriel Afolayan is in a class of his own as an actor; he always understands the task. While there is no obvious romance in this story, the chemistry between himself and Kunle Remi is the stuff of bromance: dedication and loyalty, the willingness to go all the way with and for a friend, good or bad. ",8,
"The drama is fast-paced and well apportioned; the comedy is natural and connects well with the viewers. The story line leans more towards fantasy than just drama. It is a story of family history, wayward and spoiled children who want to gain wealth the fast way, and an indulgent mother.",8,
"The picture quality of this movie is great, and the director did a good job capturing the true essence of AJ City, as Ajegunle residents like to call their neighbourhood. The schools, the market, the parties, the cons, and the street jams, were all represented. While the good guys ultimately win, I was glad to see that the conflicts are not rushed towards resolution. We enjoy the process, and identify with the characters. In addition, the major characters have developments that show us where they have been, and why they are who they are. This is refreshing. ",8,
"I enjoyed the relationship crafted between Mr. Tayo (Bimbo Manuel) and Ejiro (RMD), It is a mix of employee, friend, confidant, sparring partner, drinking buddy, and adopted brother. When it is revealed that Mr. Tayo is a product of Ajegunle, the bond between them immediately makes a lot of sense. ",8,
"Seeing Richard Mofe-Damijo (RMD)  in a different kind of role in this movie is a breath of fresh air. His role as Ejiro, a retired thug for hire and crime lord, is a complete departure from his usual role of the wealthy father, or the suave and debonair gentleman, and he kills it. Who knew RMD could demonstrate such fighting skills? But those of us who grew up watching him as Segun Kadiri understand that he has range. 
",8,
"I am not a fan of the Fast and Furious Saga, but the way Kolade handled the racing in the movie, both when he is having fun and when his life is in danger, is taken straight from the Fast and Furious franchise. It is lovely to see him handle the car so well.  Daddy Showkey is the don and major bad guy, and he wears the role well. His acting needs some work, but he did not disappoint.  ",8,
"Seven reminds me of an American Movie, the Ultimate Gift, with a Nigerian twist, and it achieved its aim, as well as provides an unexpected twist at the end. Seven takes us from Abuja to Lekki, and to Ajegunle, one of the slum cities of Lagos. Ajegunle has its own flavour and brand of justice: when the people have had enough from those terrorizing them, the people fight back. 

Efa Iwara, as Kolade, is the ultimate spoiled rich kid, depending on his trust fund, and burning it at both ends. When he gets the task he needs to complete to get his inheritance, he kicks against it at first, then turns around to display an uncommon sense of empathy when he saw what would happen if he does not carry out the task.  ",8,
"The actors in Mama Drama gave a great performance, so much so that you would believe they are experiencing all the pain, joy, and every emotion in the movie. But the stars are Kehinde Bankole, Shaffy Bello, and Osas Ighodaro. They all have such on-screen chemistry, and there is minimal overacting.

I would have preferred if some actions in the last scenes of the court were toned down, but it did not take away too much from the movie, and it is good to see it end not just happily ever after, but more true to life. ",8,
"The movie is well paced and has good, short scenes that pass across the message succinctly. The scenes are very tight and punchy. The camera focuses are poignant; they keep the focus on the emotions. We have no need to see the person giving the message. No words are necessary, but the responses are perfect, evoking emotions in us the viewers.  ",8,
"The storyline of Mama Drama is like a refreshing glass of rare wine, something different and unusual. It pushes the envelope. Fertility issues and alternative options is what our Nigerian society would rather be hush about, but more people are embracing them, even if secretly. 

I must say Osas and Shaffy were in their elements in this beautiful movie of love, pain, cultural integration, societal pressure, and medical issues. Osas is the perfect embodiment of the long-suffering daughter-in-law from a different tribe, doing her best to cope with fertility issues, and getting the flak from her very traditional Yoruba mother-in-law.

The subject of the movie is a sensitive one, but the actors and directors do such beautiful justice to it, without detracting from the seriousness of the issue. We are well entertained.",8,
"One of the first things that strike you in This Lady Called Life are the vivid colours, they give the movie such a great quality. In addition, the locations add to the appeal of the movie and makes the movie relatable. While there are no unusual camera angles or special cinematic effects, what we have is beautifully and artfully done, and leaves a good feeling.  ",8,

"This Lady Called Life is a gentle and sweet romantic comedy woven around the issues of childhood parental abuse and of generational curses.   

The story is unusual, scripted around a subject that many would prefer to keep hidden away or discarded, like we would a bottle of poor quality wine. Yet, it is lovely to see this matter dealt with in such a way that it helps us to re-examine what we know, without exactly taking a stand. We are left to make our own judgement. ",8,
"Tina Mba is a screen goddess, and here again, she proves that she deserves every accolade she gets.  There is no role she handles that I don’t believe is truly her, from her days on television, now to the big screens. She proves herself to be a true thespian.  The chemistry between Efa Iwara and Bisola Ayeola is so lovely, and when Efa switches to his comedic role is actually hilarious. I felt like he was wooing me. ",8,
"Let me start with this. The sibling rivalry between Ghana and Nigeria is still strong and I enjoy most of the light banter. Today, I stand with my Nigerian brothers and sisters and proudly claim this African jewel. I had so many reservations about this movie; a Nigerian movie hyped by Nigerians? What's new? Admittedly there were some negatives. The shouting could have been toned down but it did nothing to take me out of the immersive experience. It's a bit slow paced but that may have been necessary due to the Lego-like story building. The acting was solid however some extras were not believable in their roles. A particular scene with a security guard was not believable. However,the production was great a d light years ahead of most of the sub-par movies of African cinema. This movie is truly a great step in the right direction for Afican cinema. If it wasn't clear enough, I'm Ghanaian",9,
"A great piece of work by Kemi Adetiba, the story was well scripted, good cinematography, all actors gave a great performance. This is a world class movie... Kudos to the all the crews",9,
"Everything about the movie was well thought out, consisting of an Amazing cast who nailed their roles, an original story and top notch videography",9,
"This movie is so worth the time. I almost didn't watch it because I thought it would end up like every other Nigerian movie I had seen, but alas! I was pleasantly surprised. The storyline is unpredictable, the acting of most of the characters are believable. The picture quality is amazing! It's hands down the best Nigerian movie I've seen in recent times, and even challenges some Hollywood movies. Kudos to Kemi Adetiba on this feat.",9,
"The best Nigerian movie I've ever seen
This movie is amazing! Very creative and not predictable. I love how the story line is current and relates to what is going on in Nigeria at the moment. The acting was great - Sola Sobowale is a legend!",9,
"Want to watch again
This is one of those Nigerian movies you watch over and over and over again. Great work all through.",9,
"Awesome Movie
Movie was awesome. Protagonist was amazing Storyline was great Choice of music was on point. Casting Great. Camera movements where on point Movie deserves every good and awesome recognition out there Production crew of King of Boys did. Great work Awesome work Kemi. You're truly the Bruce Lee of Visuals.",9,
"Unbelievable
I don't like Nigerian movies and I have never written a review on IMBD or anywhere else, but after seeing this movie yesterday, seeing it again in my dreams and waking up still thinking about it, I knew I had to write this. Very unpredictable movie, the best Nigerian movie in history. Well done Kemi Adetiba and the cast, couldn't tell that most of the actors are not so experienced when watching the movie. Well done!!",9,
"Simply the best so far
Not surprise that it is Kemi Adetiba on this one but everything about the film is the best of its kind so far in Nollywood. Of course there enough room for improvement. Cinematography was top notch but most impressive is the interpretation of the story.",9,
"Good suspense but unnecessarily long
I would rate the movie as to be a peak standard for Nigerian movies. It has its bit of suspense and great movie visuals. But still it has some unnecessary prolonged scene which were not meant to be part of the movie. Still this is a great movie for the family. Sola Sobowale is a legendary actress.",9,
"Funny, romantic film!

I went into this thinking it wouldn't be that good but I was so engrossed, the whole movie was like a ball of sunshine, it makes you laugh and smile along with the characters!",9,
"Fantastic

This for me is way better than all the over hyped nollywood wedding party, Chief daddy and what-have-you. The humour wasn't forced, it came about naturally. Fantastic acting and great plot. Really enjoyed it.",9,
"Light and funny!
ezicat15 January 2021
An absolute comedy gold with a great plot-line. From the sisters to the villains, this is a must watch! Not the mention the unexpected fantasy elements and great special effects! Highly recommended.",9,
"Chief Daddy 2
Well, the movie is good, I actually enjoyed it I got what I expected after seeing the end scene of Chief Daddy (the first movie) The actors did a good job with their roles, and yea the movie gat me laughing 😂😂 It was hilarious Well, it gat me wondering seeing most people critics about this movie Like come on, the movie was good, the plot was and is okay I see no fault, cos everything went as it should be (I'm not gonna be a spoiler 😂) The comedy, the drama, the touching part This movie is one I love this new year Those criticizing, actually you all need to rewatch Cos I see nothing bad with it, obviously nothing.... I loved it, I enjoyed it And yea, I would love to watch it again.",9,
"Dramatic rom-com
Loved this movie- the cinematography, the shots, the fashion and music was on point. Lagos looks sooooo good. The acting was very believable and I enjoyed humor in unexpected scenes like well- find out for yourself.",9,
"A movie for weekend relaxation
It's a good movie to watch with family and friends after a long week. Particularly interesting is the strength of some of the characters as they played their roles. Good job to the director, cast and crew.",9,
"Great storyline

Great storyline, excellent audio and video quality. Production was top notch! Great combination of actors👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿. I like the fact that Lara came off her high horse to know that hard work is golden, not your family wealth. I also admire Dara's resilient spirit.👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾. We hope to see more.",9,
"Great acting and love story

Loved. Loved this film. It's so refreshing to see wonderful love stories coming out of Africa. I am now searching for these actors in other movies.",9,
"What it means to be Nigerian

Without spoilers: This movie is a lionhearted depiction of what it means to be a decent human being who keeps trying to do what is right, despite evolving cultures, sexes, differences of opinion and the painful history of Nigeria. Without a detailed backstory as to why there is almost a millennium-old ethnic friction among over 300 Nigerian tribes in one country, this movie did an excellent job of portraying the essence of being Nigerian, being a person (male or female) and showing how the country can evolve to live in unity despite cultural differences. It is also an ode to the bond of family, roots of any culture and using the best of both international exposure with being Nigerian to create different facets of what a success story for anyone can be. It had the pleasantly surprising comedy, a fresh take on what predecessors can do for their successors and so many sublime messages touching on love, family, culture, politics, leadership, feminine strength (no nauseating feminism I promise) that can be easy to miss.

Well done Genevieve Nnaji: a movie for all to see. Kudos Naija, keep improving.",9,
"LIONHEART: A Genevieve Nnaji's Love Letter To Nigeria.

#LIONHEART: Genevieve Nnaji Sold Nigeria To The World Like a Popular Brand. A GIANT Leap.

Those Who Didn't Buy Atleast Saw It.

She Took The Defunct Nigerian Home Movie Back Home To Enugu, Nigeria. That's BRAVE. It Paid off. Yes, We Can Indeed Package Nigeria To The International Market From Wherever, Be It Lagos, Enugu, Port-Harcourt, Kano, Warri, Jos, Owerri, Ibadan Or Calabar.

LIONHEART Helped In The Selling of Nigeria's Home Made Cars, INNOSON VEHICLES, @innosonvehicles To The World.

A Very NOTABLE STRIDE.

Just Like Lionheart, You Also Did Great,

Genevieve Nnaji MFR.",9,
"Wholesome and lovingly shot
Lionheart is a lovely movie that used long shots to show of the scenery quite well. If you know anything about progressive Igbo families, you know they are entrepreneurial and very family-oriented, Lionheart captured that beautifully.

It is not the typical fare in Nigerian cinema where one is guaranteed a diabolical plot full of pain, wickedness and over-acting. Lionheart is written, directed and acted by the best in class, with just the right amount of comedy thrown in, thanks to Nkem Owoh's character.

I heartily recommend.",9,
"Humbling, Heartwarming, Funny, & Empowering",9,
"Best Nollywood movie

This is not your regular Nollywood movie. This move promoted the Igbo language and culture, Innoson motors, entrepreneurial spirit. It celebrated the African girl child that all children are equal and important regardless of gender. It promoted the wisdom in African proverbs. It promoted the good deeds done to strangers.

Cinematography is great. The music score is nice. The casting was done brilliantly. Nothing over the top.

Genevieve is a national treasure. She truly deserves her national award, MFR. This movie will stand the test of time. A movie for the culture.",9,
"Brilliant movie

From the ibo cultural piont of view a masterpiece. Very different from the lot. I like that some plots differed from the usual African film expectations; where you can predict what will happen next. Kudos Genny!!",9,
"Adorable...

A very good plot, a mix of suspense and superstition, predictable until the end, with a good plot twist, good performances, in love with the works of Kunle Afolayan, who always acts in his films, in which he directs, writes and produces, multifunctional ... Adorable...",9,
"This is a story...

I beg to disagree with many of the other (negative) reviews. I believe that the movie communicated the right intensity. It's not about the book, it's about a story needing to be told. I'm a Nigerian who is closely intimidated with the war and the true story, and this film did enough to express the reality of it on many levels. I especially appreciated the live footage. I've been reading memoirs from a variety of ethnicities who were involved in the war, and this movie shows a story that is consistent with all of their stories. It's only one perspective, and fictional at that. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone interested in Nigerian history and heritage.",9,
"Great Film

I hesitated viewing the film before reading the novel. After seeing the film, I am more intrigued about the novel and the history behind it. This is a GREAT FILM, make no mistake about it.

The staff and cast did a great job in tone, symbolism and portrayal. From reading the various reviews posted here, I get a sense that many feel either a film should stick directly to the way the novel unfolds; and that's certainly not the case.

The other major point of contention seems to be that the film is meant to ""entertain"". Though a movie should hold one's attention, the main point of this film is to enlighten the viewer, while adding another layer of protection to the viewer's sensibilities.",9,
"It was Fantastic!! Ignore the negative reviews

Honestly. It was mindblowing! Didn't even believe it was shot in Nigeria, the production was special and the cast were A1. They all played thier parts well and made it fun!",9,
"Brilliant!

Kemi, your work is outstanding. You just keep absolutely getting better. Can't wait for future productions. Was thoroughly entertained.💃👍",9,
"Nice movie for the holidays

A funny, spirited comedy that is thoroughly enjoyable to watch. Good acting, great use of settings, brings out the various dynamics of Nigerian family, friends, societal struggles and quests for love and money.",9,
"A film that simply seeks to raise awareness.

Until when will we keep silent about gender sexual harassment? This film tackles this scandalous and little treated subject in a masterful way. Invites and encourages not to remain silent when you are sexually harassed, to raise your voice and not see it as something normal or something that happened because of carelessness or because someone caused it. It shows both the version of the victim and the perpetrator making it interesting. It seeks to awaken in women the awareness of raising their voices and it succeeds. It is about an international academic who is accused of sexual harassment by the best student in the class and they are taken to the school hearing to clarify things, but the situations that arise turn the case around. Quality. Entertaining Baffling. Current. Safety pin. Slightly parsimonious, they abuse the detail of developing each thing in the last situation, so the duration of 2 hours and 30 minutes. The script is interesting and smart. Some performances are at the level and others not so much. Told in two times where the present is in full screen and the past in cinema mode. A film that simply seeks to raise awareness. A powerful African drama.",9,
"NOT A FAN OF NIGERIAN MOVIES, BUT THIS ONE PLEASES

Not a fan of Nigerian movies, but this one pleases. A solid hollywood grade, eye glueing 2hrs 30mins intense ride. Graphics and vfx is visually transfixing, even though it wasn't shot with the Alexa or Miramax.. the operator behind the DSLR knows his tweaks. Audio is superb. Shot in Senegal though, set locations are amazing. The cast director selected wisely, the actors impressively reincarnate the true events back to life. Overall, its a cinematic masterpiece, hence the Netflix distribution.",9,
"Outstanding performance

Temi Otedola's performance was truly stunning. I thoroughly enjoyed the layers that the story had and the way that each key piece of information was revealed.",9,
"If it were food I would say mouth watering

The film citation is a necessity, I do not see where it would ever run out of relevance. The actors were carefully picked and displayed such professionalism, the location were amazing never new had such good universities in Senegal , the arts and craft of our African leaders carved out the African identity.

The message this movie carries, how it was told is so special, insightful and artistic. The suspense is on another level, the melange of feelings it creates to us the viewers is something else.

Citation is a must watch go watch it on NETFLIX",9,
"Spot On!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Definitely African movie of the year, enjoyed every minute of the 2hours 30minutes 😀👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥✔✌",9,

I should have rated this movie 100% but nothing can be 100% perfect even though the entirety of the movie is close to perfection. Mr kunle Afolayan has never disappointed us for once right from the day's of #irapada,it's always from one level of professionalism to another. Always amazing and giving the best.",9,
Kunle afolayan master piece,9,
"Accurate
This movie talks about Nigeria and her politicians or politheivecians as I call them. Who are all jokers and comedians in a different area of life who decided to go into politics and toil with people's lives as much as they want entertain you on campaigns and forget what they were elected for. Big ups to the producers, actors and actresses, directors and the rest of the crew, nice movie budget especially when comparing it in the nollywood. Everything was nice but we would have loved if the movie was concluded in a way it should have been and not in suspense or another part or sequel to be released later on. Good movie especially if you are Nigerian and not interested in party or favouritism from the leaders. Just shows you the people we elect as leaders in this country are comedians who lack idea on how to rule a country. Once again big ups to everyone.",9,
It's a really nice movie..,9,
"Funny Funny Funny

Oh mehn, this movie is super funny. if you are looking for a movie to lift your mood up then this is the right movie for you.",9,
"The timing of this film must be written in the stars. It is an original twist on a themes of family/ racism / fascism. Profound moments of child craving for a family and intimacy, alongside abusive grooming. It punches you in the stomach. Kudos to the writer/director who worked tirelessly to get the project on screen an the major U.K film funders stayed away from it. He also took the project to Creative England's iFeatures but didn't make the cut... In a way, it works to the writer/directors hand to have a told a bold British story based on a True Story with Hanway films. Watch & Support playing now!",9,
"Farming is a excellent film but my god is it a tough watch

This was by far one of the best movies I have seen this year. I do not know why the rating is so bad. This movie is by far better than some of the movies that have received Oscars including Moonlight.

Farming is an extremely tough movie to watch. Every scene comes down on you... Hard enough to either make you cry out in pain, anger or just good old plain frustration. I couldn't stop cursing!",9,
"Read movie! Don't understand why this got such a low rating!
",9,
"Very disturbing but gripping

This was one of the most uncomfortable films I've watched and made me feel quite emotional. I was unfamiliar with 'farming' until this film and thank you to the writer and director for making it free to view during this time of the BLM stuggles 2020. The story drew me in and the characters were well acted and believable. The story was unrelentingly tense throughout. The ending gives no answers to the issues explored in the film but leaves the viewer to grapple with them. Very glad to have watched this and it will stay with me for a while",9,
"Sadly accurate, disturbing but incredibly engaging.

I grew up during this time period and sadly resonate with some of the issues which were brought up in this film. I have a close friend who also experienced ""farming"" and it still has repercussions in her and her family's life today. The film was sadly disturbing, but unfortunately accurate in a number of it's depictions of the era in the UK. I was shocked at the final revelation as to who Enitan is in real life, which definitely - as already explained by another reviewer - enhanced the emotional climax.

Excellent, albeit sad, but well worth watching if only for the historical context.",9,
"A fun-filled rollercoaster of emotions

If you're an open-minded, hopeless romantic, you'll definitely enjoy watching this movie. I thought that the lead characters had great chemistry and the supporting cast delivered fine performances as well. It was interesting to see the clash of cultures exposed and finally resolved amicably. There's plenty of humour, drama and tense moments to hold your interest. Certainly makes my favourite list.",9,
"An unlikely lovestory well told

Love the message of the film, and there should be many more like it: We are all people so lets not look at our differences but what unites us. Loved the chemistry between the two mean protagonists. A Bollywood movie told bj an Indian female director with a great heart for Africa/Nigeria. Respect to her for telling such a nice story. It was a bit over the top sometimes but the main premise was clear. Let's all love each other. Mock me but I winked away a few tears, hopeless romantic and big believer in cross cultural marriages that I am. Just to be clear got to know Bollywood through my wife, who is Indonesian, and discoverer Nollywood through Netflix because I loved Africa when I worked there manier year ago. Geert, a Belgian,",9,
"A must watch

The movie was amazing, its a must watch. If you want to pass time quickly watch this. I love the taxi scene, it is my favourite.",9,
"Great Movie about relationship with God

I totally enjoyed watching this movie, it stirred up something in my spirit to be persistent with my walk with God and was a reminder that He is my father I can always talk to anytime. There is room for improvement for a better execution.",9,
"God called me.......
As He is my witness, I was guided to view this awesome movie yesterday. Even though I was looking for a movie for distraction, I was compelled to watch this extraordinarily crafted movie yesterday. It fell in line perfectly with the personal spiritual search I've been on lately. During the time I watched, answer after answer to so many questions came to me. I'm still astounded.

Watch this, please, with an open mind.",9,
"Gem of a documentary, educational, hilarious, heartfelt, basically an emotional rollercoaster

I was lucky to catch this last night playing to a full house at the London Film Week film festival on 3rd Dec 2019, competing in a select group of only seven feature-length films in official competition including Scorsese's ""The Irishman"" and the latest films by Takashi Mike, Armando Iannucci, and the already multi-award-winning Marriage Story by Noah Baumbach so my expectations were high when seeing it selected to compete in such highly esteemed company, thankfully I wasn't to be disappointed as it proved to be the best doco I've watched since ""The Dawn Wall"" (2017), though not comparable in content, I found the personal honesty truly moving and inspiring. I watch a lot of documentaries and visit a lot of film festivals as I love to discover new talent to share with my friends so I feel very privileged to be able to be the first to review this little gem. Buddy Munro (the star, entertainer, explorer, comedian and a man working his way forward in life through therapy after a deeply traumatic accident as a child) is a true force of nature. Superbly edited by Ben Hooten the film deftly intercuts between Buddy's madcap adventures in Nollywood and a deeply moving interview where we discover what made him who he is. Within minutes we cut from scenes inducing tears of laughter to ones so moving they produce tears of sadness, simply an emotional rollercoaster. This debut Directorial feature by Michael Lebor (which he also shot) has a great deal of charm, was thoroughly entertaining and I cannot recommend highly enough you taking the time to seek it out and to watch this powerful and life-affirming film, both Buddy and Michael and all involved have clearly arrived, expect to hear a lot more from this very talented group of filmmakers.",9,
"The portrait of life that emerges organically from this understated, observant approach makes Eyimofe the rare social realist drama that conveys critique without didacticism and empathy without pity.",9,
"Through an economy of exposition, Eyimofe, (translated as “This is My Desire”) delivers a timeless, universal portrait of human resilience while establishing Arie and Chuko as a welcome new addition to the filmmaking brood.",9,
"Colorful and detailing but thrilling isn't the word

Women are the focal point and Lagos is just a beauty. One could watch the movie without blinking the eye starring at what never looks like Lagos, but still is. Funny and lively, one smiles dubiously even when you are being portrayed on screen as either one of the women or few of the guys or perhaps the parents. Pity, Hatred and repetition seem to surrounds the movie as seen in Lekki Bridge; and among the women whose connections wasn't detailed much. Bandele's work is evident and he is really making a world renowned brand with Nigerian stories. In general, Fifty is standard, beautiful and lively, it is expected to be thrilling at the end but the goose in my pimples didn't show off much but I was happy remembering few lines and scenes at the end.",9,
"Simply relating the narrative of Andrew Dosunmu’s seductive immigrant drama Mother of George would do little to convey the film’s stark, poetic power, much less its extraordinary visual and sonic acumen.",9,
"As Adenike, Gurira is wonderful: Her face is equally radiant whether she's channeling anguish or joy, and she captures the ways in which this woman, so old-country dutiful, also longs to join the modern world.",9,
"The most visually arresting drama of 2013, and certainly one of the year’s best films.",9,
"This is not a fable of assimilation or alienation, but rather the keenly observed story of two people seeking guidance in painful and complicated circumstances.",9,
"It is the kind of distinctive, culture-driven drama from emerging filmmakers that I wish we saw more of.",9,
"Nigerians in Brooklyn
Mother of George (2013) was directed by Andrew Dosunmu. It stars the lovely Danai Gurira as Adenike Balogun, newly married to Ayodele Balogun (Isaach De Bankolé). Although the setting is Brooklyn, we're shown that the old ways brought over from Nigeria still have a profound effect on people's behavior.

The title of the movie, ""Mother of George,"" is realistic. As much as the young couple love each other, they are under the spell of George's mother, who controls many aspects of their life and their destiny.

The central plot theme is that, for whatever reason, Adenike doesn't conceive. This is never easy for any couple, but it's particularly difficult in the Nigerian culture, where a woman is supposed to conceive quickly, and often.

This is an amazing film, suspenseful, thoughtful, and colorful. We saw it at Rochester's wonderful Little Theatre. You'll lose some of the sense of the neighborhood and the costumes on the small screen, but it will work well enough to definitely be worth seeing.",9,
"With drama and efficiency... Pefect and very sad...

Against the background, the independence of Nigeria, including using this remarkable date in the title, and only because it is an excellent police thriller, in search of a serial killer who kills and violently kills virgins in a distant tribe of Nigeria, in a beautiful Nigerian production, full of colors, very exciting to observe the African tribal culture, through the clothing, food, behavior (including the machismo of patriarchy, in which girls have to marry virgins and have difficulties to study), and with drama and efficiency...",9,
"Understated, powerful crime drama with historical flavor
This was a very character rich film. Not a single scene was wasted. You feel taken by the hand invisibly by the storyteller and shown things that seem unimportant perhaps or out of context at the time, yet slowly but surely build towards powerful scenes and an inescapable conclusion. You don't have to know any Nigerian history to get a sense of the buzz in the air about the country's independence which was being launched at the time this provincial crime investigation takes place. It's also worth noting that the investigation does not rely on common tropes such as what a genius the investigator but rather on an organic navigation through unfamiliar territory and peculiar characters interacting in a fluid, at times comical at times dangerous framework.",9,
"Lovely glimpse of a ground-breaking time
When I was a kid in the early 60's, I'd come down to the breakfast table and find my stepfather reading about the Congo. For a little while, it was all over the news. I don't know if the Congo occupied the news in other metropolitan areas the way it did in Detroit. It really meant something there, probably because of Detroit's large black population.

I remember as I glimpsed the blaring headlines and asked my stepfather what it all meant words like ""independence."" There was the name Patrice Lumumba and the seeming inevitability that he would be killed for his cause. The movie October 1 is set in Nigeria and does not mention Lumumba or necessarily take sides -- it is assumed everyone's for independence except possibly for the grudgingly accepting British empire forces who are still running things while planning to begin handing over power to a new Nigerian government, on Oct. 1, 1960. But the countrymen's anticipation of this ground-breaking transition is a still slightly uncertain backdrop to a detective trying to solve a string of murders and find his footing among his rulers.

I started the movie expecting it to be interestingly amateurish as have been some movies I have seen from that part of the world ... peeks into a lifestyle that no matter how nascent are little different from anyone else's. Made in Africa by Africans, the movie seemed to have grass-roots production values but then I realized that was only because they reflected the milieu. In Nigeria in 1960 people still lived very close to the land. There would be a lot of foliage and open-air buildings to be seen. I loved the fabrics out of which women made cottony dresses featuring large emblematic portraits of their leaders.

But as the movie progressed, I realized it did not suffer in production values at all; in fact, it was superior in some ways to anything I have seen coming out of the West lately. Perhaps the filmmakers did need to be creative for lack of a budget but I liked the way sometimes something, a sound, for instance, would get a special treatment, almost as if we could see the shock waves extending out on the screen. It has been a couple of months since I saw the movie and I have been wishing to write this review all that time so, please forgive me, I don't remember exactly the events being so depicted, they might have been a sound, or an emotion, or both. But I found the effects simple but evocative,

I'm not going to go into the plot other than to say that some of its turns are surprising and adult and may not be suitable for children. But I think you'll like our detective, a man of dignity and sense and who is quite thin. Whoa. He is quite appealing. Winterbottom is dashing, too -- keep an eye out for Nick Rhys. But in Inspector Danny Waziri, Sadiq Daba nails the role of a lifetime. I have to add that I think Tunde Babalola's script was brilliant, understanding so well both sides of the transitiion and knowing when to crescendo. Even though the gaining of independence is not explained like a history lesson, it is an interesting snapshot of how the countrymen responded and an intriguing context for the movie's events and the detective's courage. October 1 is a great little movie. P.S. Maybe director Kunle Afolayan would like to make one of his future projects a biography of Lumumba, if it wouldn't be too controversial. From surveying a Wikipedia entry about Lumumba, he seems to have fit my cursory childhood take on him as a tragic leader.",9,
"How NOT to do political drama

When I started watching the 'The Governor', I had hoped that, at the very least, I would learn a little about the Nigerian political system, or even just Nigeria in general, the way 'The West Wing' showed us the politics of the USA and Borgen showed us the political landscape of Denmark. I was sorely disappointed. The show follows Angela Ochello (portrayed by Caroline Chikezie) as she assumes the post of Governor of Savannah State in Nigeria after the death of her predecessor. Almost from the beginning, the show goes hopelessly wrong. IN an attempt to portray the main character as 'good', she is shown to be hopelessly naive, to the point that she is amazed at the existence of corruption in politics. This despite having been the vice-governor for several years. But that's the least of the show's problems. What is far worse is that the people producing it seem to be allergic to exposition or any form of conveying background information. After a whole season, I still have no idea what Savannah State is like. There are no panning shots, no discussion of its politics or economy. I don't even know what the main character's authority consists of! Half the time she seems to operate as a dictator, who can operate as she wants without having to acknowledge a local legislature or for that matter the national government. Perhaps people in Nigeria know all these things, but when you bring a show onto the international market, you need to educate your public. We're not going to watch the show with our computers open on the relevant wikipedia pages. Add an almost soap-like framing of the shots and acting that borders on the ridiculous, varying between the wooden and the insanely theatrical, and you end up with a mess of a show. It;s a pity, because this could have been very interesting. But as it is, it's just total amateur hour.",9,
"Worth watching
Set against the backdrop of the 1976 coup attempt in Nigeria this is a good movie. Not much shoot em up but good drama.",9,
"Absolutely Stunning Picture

Incredible. Rarely do I see Nollywood movies adapted from true life situations, especially from a dated era where so much attention to detail is paid. The lighting, cinematography, props are so beautiful, this movie can definitely be categorized as modern classic. The retro feel it give is so breathtaking that nothing looks out of place throughout the 2 hour duration of the movie. Incredible casting as well! I was especially impressed by the performance of Adonijah Owiriwa who plays Captain V. M. Jaiye. Overall I loved the movie in it's entirety and hope more directors and producers can provide more movies reading between the lines of historic events. 9/10 for me.",9,

That politically correct, socially critical film based on real facts we love, the hospital director who chooses to hire pregnant doctors/mothers... A beautiful tribute to Ameyo Adadevoh, who saved countless lives by quarantining a big shot, and the hypotheses of an American conspiracy (not mentioned in the film), beautiful, beautiful, sad and necessary... #VivaOsDoctors #VivaOSUS... It was already said that Danny Glover looked like him, until he found out that he ""was"" himself... What helps give visibility and even credibility to a great film, which portrays such a current theme, a pandemic threat...",9,
"Nurse's opinion

I'm a nurse in the USA and what stood out to me the most about this film was how humble and humane the doctors and medical staff were even though they were terrified of contracting ebola. They still treated their patients and one another with kindness and humility and supported one another emotionally. I thought this was an excellent film and the actors and actresses did an excellent job.",9,
"A great tribute to the medical staff

I just finished watching movie, during the rising of COVIT-19 pandemic. What the medical team at had gone through is happening everywhere in the world. The movie showed me what is really like in the time of crisis in their lives and not just statistical numbers of how many more infected in the news. I appreciate this movie and even more, I appreciate all the doctors and nurses in the world for their noble and humble work ethics, risking their lives to save ours.",9,
"Excellent Storyline and Great Characters

Can't wait for Season 2!!! The show is well written, the characters are fully developed and the story lines are complex. The female characters are strong and dynamic and all of the actors own their roles and develop manage to deliver the twist and turns of the plots. Well down Netflix! I am huge fan of the Nigerian cinema Netflix delivers. It is not canned remakes of American or British TV. it is a great introspective into the lives of Nigerians for the global audience.",9,
"Great TV Show!
Thoroughly enjoyed season 1, the storylines and plot are compelling and I like that how it also has a comedy side to it. Can't wait for season 2! Congrats to the cast!",9,
"Slow Burn to Brilliant
Castle & Castle takes the best of the legal service industry and showcases it exquisitely. Some of the names not just in the cast but in production show that painstaking detail has been taken to produce something realistic of an ideal legal industry in Lagos. Expect excellent production value. Acting is not our strongest forte in Nigeria, sometimes characters seem detached and untethered to the reality of their immediate situation (like having a conversation they've already had before) and in the start you may be tempted to think that is all there is to it, but if you stopped there you'd miss out on an excellent storyline that gradually draws you in. We love drama, so you'll get that, and aside for some funny scenes where the actors are struggling to not laugh themselves you start to warm quickly to the characters- Stella is a joker (a difficult character socioculturally and demographic-wise both posh and street not easy to do). I am a Litigator and I am impressed by the work put in, I was held by the storyline and I truly applaud a really impressive piece of work. Here's to excellence in the arts because this one closely imitates life. Well done guys, very well done. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾",9,
"Cleared season 2.. where's 3?

Was never a fan Naijja films,neither am i a 'series perso, but this has been quite a ride bingeing on a whole season in one day.

Season 3 better be upcoming soon i reckon.

Good on you Naijja !",9,
"
Superb movie!!
This has got to be the best made movie to come out of Nigeria, not to mention hilariously funny! It seamlessly interweaves the story of two very different people - a Nigerian villager and a proper British woman - with coherence, continuity and content that most Nigerian movies lack. Each of Usuofia and Samantha has the opportunity to live in the other's domain (see part 2) and the movie does justice to the cultural difficulties experienced by each. Well worth your time.

To thoroughly enjoy this movie (and its sequel), one would have to be vaguely familiar with the Nigerian culture. Anyone however, can understand and follow what's happening.

Downside: there are relatively high variations in volume and noise levels throughout the movie making some of what is said difficult to decipher; some of the camera shots were also wacky. If you can ignore those few things, you're in for a ride!",9,
"Enjoyable
This movie is enjoyable. Just keep an open mind, It is nice to see how upcoming actors and musicians can hold their own.

Kudos to Obi, the cast and crew for this great job. The music was dope too

I binge-watched it.",9,

I binge watched season one. It was awesome. T he only reason I didn't give ten stars is a couple camera mishaps but it was an awesome story and plot from the first to last episode! Please bring it back!",9,
"Up North the Movie was superb

This film shows off beautiful aspects of Northern Nigeria particularly Bauchi state. I can't wait to visit with my friends. Thank you for telling a beautiful story!",9,
"Praise Jesus today because tomorrow may be too late!""

Top-tier Nigerian B-movie directed by a pastor with highlights that include the gory removal of a fetus from a pregnant woman, a prostitute paid to lick a nasty scab, a devil baby with horns, gay rape and much more. All with typically shoddy Nollywood FX, hilariously energetic acting and heavy-handed religious propaganda.

The best characters in the movie are a priest who enthusiastically spreads the word of god on the street in lengthy sequences, and a devil child (the horned baby eight years later) who crawls through the ground and terrorizes random civilians.

If you love terrible movies you must watch this at least once. The second part is worth a watch as well and features several scenes that easily outdo this chapter in terms of sheer insanity. Unfortunately, it features too many boring sermons and prayer scenes, and a new pastor who lacks the entertaining energy of the previous. Watching relatively normal sermons isn't as funny as watching a priest yell about God in a bar and bothering all the customers. Shame.

This one however gets my full recommendation.",9,
"Great documentary

Spent the entire time looking at her beautiful skin( bev naya) and listening to the soothing soundtrack. people will always lighten , tan, tattoo,reduce , bind their feet , implant, etc to enhance beauty according to whatever is popular at the time so dont see a big issue here , people want that stunning attractiveness Beverly has.",9,

This is a very good and distinct movie. Some people might not like it perhaps because they are used to the love or thriller story films or perhaps because they are not used to life with a vehicle.

"Good film

With a small budget this film deserve a very good critic.Finally a film with a gay theme without a tragedy. One moving story, with good actors.I recognize problems with edition, and other small Technics problems.But who care about this, when we see a film so full of truth and tenderness??? Sometimes I ask me why films about gay man are sad,dramatic? Why can we have a film with gay thematic without hope? Some scenes for me were really sublime. The story is very sensitive, principally because the plot is about black, gay and poor people. I would like to see more films like this: simple, direct, full of truth, one real story.This story can happen.",9,
"Great film - entertained and educated

W Sharpe Director of New Media, Public Broadcasting Atlanta  30th July 2007 ""I recently saw the film Rag Tag during the National Black Arts Festival in Atlanta. I thought it was a bold, daring, provocative film. I was surprised at the reaction of some of the viewers of the film and their objection to the subject matter.

I think that the Arts Festival is exactly the place to exhibit such works. It is a place for artists to exhibit their craft and enlighten to public through their art. Please do not censor future content. I have learnt many things through the films presented at the Arts Festival and it would be a shame if the narrow minded views of a few stifled lifelong learning. 

The film has been a topic of discussion among the friends I brought with me to screen the film and those who were not in attendance. I'd like to know if the film is in release on DVD or will be screened at any other festivals around the country."" 

C Anderson - 8th and 10th August, 2007 ""I just saw Rag Tag at the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Film Festival. It was Great. I felt that the audience at the showing I attended really responded positively to the film (and it was a full house). The accents were certainly present, but they were by no means a hindrance. I am probably more challenged by a strong southern accent from the USA - and that's in my own country!",9,
"On the 1st of August, a graduation party brings more than anyone expected.

The film is a suburban drama that examines how a family manages to survive its past, and how that past is inextricably entwined with their future. 

During a graduation party, the estranged father, Dipo, returns. Each family member deals with his return differently, and thus we see how they must have survived his initial departure. As we learn the reasons for his departure and the reasons for his return, our sympathies shift.

The film is well acted and the story unfolds itself smoothly and naturally, without resorting to exposition. It is refreshing to see a dramatic film about African Americans that veers from stereotypes.",9,
"Good movie

Both Okon and Bona are excited about the opportunities in London and are quickly shown the racist and selfish realities of living there. Though both are educated and came for educational enrichment, they are exploited and thrust into homelessness, even betrayed by fellow Nigerians living in London. Luckily Bona meets with some compassionate folks who help him and provide shelter, food and companionship. He is also able to help Okon when they happen upon each other in the city. Glad the ending had one of them going back with the goal of enriching and giving back to his homeland.",9,

An excellent Nollywood plot, a dose of mystery, well tied, well produced, delighted to marathon the Nigerian works of Netflix, catches you, entertains, goes off the conventional route, here the African culture is in the background, adapting to the Western one, but latent in colors, beaches, clothing, very passionate... And the strong personalities of the female characters, predominant, adorable... Great outcome...",9,
"Fun and deeper than anticipated

A well crafted story and an excellent addition to the new Nollywood wave. Gradually the movie reveals itself to be an allegory on taking risks and the journey to self discovery. It also maintains the ever present Nigerian theme of the wisdom of elderly. The lead actress's understated sarcasm and endearing but awkward interactions make the gradual journey of self reflection all the more magical. The ending really did it for me. Beautiful!",9,
"Petition for a season 2!

I really really loved this and could totally relate, interesting from start to finish, kudos to cast and directors. Can there be a season and maybe better publicity?",9,
"A must watch!

One word describes this movie, BRILLIANT!!! From beginning to end, the hairs on the back of my neck couldn't stop standing. The story line was simple yet captivating, the acting was bang on and flawless. The delivery of the movie was done with such ease and humor that I secretly wished it wouldn't end. Mary is a sweet girl that any man would gladly ""take home to mama"" (kinda made me wonder how she was still single). While Akin is your archer-type male, whom I suspected had a wicked sense of humor. The character of the twins and Mary's sister provided an appropriate dose of comic relief. I must admit I am extremely proud of the cast and crew, Nigeria was highlighted as a pleasant place to be. I will definitely be getting the DVD when it comes out. PHONE SWAP has proved to be a must see classic of our time.",9,
"Love this Film

I just saw this film last night at the AFI film fest and it deeply had a profound effect on me. I will enjoy watching it for many years to come and the conversations that it will spark. It features engaging performances by the entire cast about how a modern Nigerian woman is pressured by her family to produce a male heir. Shot in the Igbo language with English subtitles, the film works on many levels including the timing, and pauses. The acting is very natural without melodrama and it feels very believable. Overall, the film was riveting and kept me really engaged. 

Shot in about a two-week time period, filmmaker, Chika Anadu soars in her first feature film, which presents a critique and glance on Igbo cultural traditions and discriminatory preferences for males. It's too bad that we won't see new film releases from this filmmaker for a while, as she plans to take a break and make commercials for a bit.",9,
"The plot twist is different. Kudos

I'm a fan of Nigerian films. This one is different. The plot twist is different that I couldn't predict nor see anything coming. Kudos to the writer Ifeanyi Opara. The actors were super too. Characters were well interpreted",9,
"Amazing work of art!

Doctor Lanre will leave you glued to your seat all through. Great story, amazing cast, fantastic rendition of lines and suspense filled. The story is so unique, a diversion from the regular Nollywood love story. I look forward to more intriguing stories from the writer. I will definitely recommend that you see this.",9,
"A Good and Wise film. It was a good film, that shows the dangers of Nigerian tribalism and how it can affect a young love. I am glad that it did not descend into stereotypes (too much), as both Yoruba and Igbo tribes were portrayed as dignified and with a lot of love for their children. The only two things I would have loved for them to do is to make the police tip have been anonymous, rather than arresting the Igbo father.

Both fathers should have had to live with the guilt of ruining their children's lives, and thus their own. No additional punishment would have been necessary. Also, they should have delved deeper into the wickedness of the Yoruba witchcraft tradition. That juju should have been shown as the direct cause of Stella's death.

I hope that Nigerian films continue to get better and develop this way. I am in the film industry in America and want to bring our culture to the world stage!",9,
"An excellent short documentary

Warning: Spoilers
Blood rider was an excellent short film following the high-stakes career Joseph takes on as a blood rider. The stakes are raised further as someone close to Joseph is hospitalizes suddenly and is in need of blood at short notice. The cinematography does an excellent job in conveying the tense situations that Joseph is put in when delivering blood, and the emotions he grapples with when patients are lost. Definitely worth the watch.",9,

Having said that, s/he definitely had a lot of good to work with. From production to story-telling, it's exquisiteness all the way. In fact, the acting is so genuine, it is perplexing. Even the extras deserve Oscars. Beautiful. Just so damn beautiful.

The energy here is a rush. It will make you feel like you are in court. So forget the trailer's portrayal: 'Charge & Bail' is no ordinary comedy. It is serious business. Asides its banging editing, an intricately woven story & an excellent closing make it -a story of many bests- we have seen in Nollywood in a very very, very long time.

One shouldn't miss this. Especially writers, producers & ALL practitioners in Nollywood. Because 'Charge & Bail' is a standout. It's nothing like your usual Nollywood comedy. If it's a comedy at all, it's a comedy for intelligent people. One that makes bursting into laughter, a result of your brain being tickled. Exceptional. 🏆",9,
"Super Recommended! 'Gold Statue' is Magnificent Excellence. It promises a mountain of fun. And with that mountain, comes rivers of quality and an avalanche of Perfect acting performances. This movie is worth every penny you will spend and more. So much more; it practically tore the screening hall to pieces. This is Gold!

A thirty-something strong audience was held spell bound from start to finish. And that is a Very Big something considering 'Gold Statue' runs for a mighty two hours and twenty five minutes. But forget the longevity- Trust us you want to see this movie. It is two hours and twenty five minutes of starchy undiluted fun. And that fun doesn't come unaccompanied.

Rather, it comes distinguished by top of the line quality in every single area. The amount of sheer effort to deliver pristine quality is indescribable. You have to see it. For Nollywood; it is Amazing. Acting is a hundred. Make-up a hundred. CGI a hundred. Props a hundred and fifty. And the story?

That one is just Mad. Literally. Dictionary-Ly. Mad! PS: Whoever did the make-up for a post-lynched Gabriel Afolayan in the opening scene deserves a gold medal. To that make-up artist; we say Bravo! We honour you.

I wouldn't even take a bathroom break, I almost wet myself! I forgot I could pause the movie and return.

Ms Adetibe assuaged a thirst I had always longed for: Nigeria in all its realness. Politics, religion, poverty, wealth, God-fatherism, entitlement mentality, corruption and then HOPE. Hope in the Nigeria embodied in the person of Officer Gobir. The cast even makes me more proud - all indigenous!

It could be done and She did it! A Nollywood movie worthy of export!

"Excellent
shophallowaynorth22 February 2021
I finally came across this movie via Netflix. I know that it no longer qualifies as a new release and that is the misfortune for so many films created on the international stage---once they are able to be consumed by mainstream audieces state-side, they are no longer the ""new hotness"".

As an Black American (our viewership and support of films has been known to offer legendary box office results stateside and internationally), I have to say that this film brings Nigerian films into the here and now with great production and a storyline which while not Academy Awards level (very few movies actually are which is why it remains the peak of performance standards for an international community), it is CERTAINLY in the category of iconic cult gangster classics such as ""Scarface"" or ""The Godfather"".

In fact, I was trying to consider when exactly a film which placed a woman as a kingpin in the front and center of the story had been done in American cinema...and unfortunately despite America's heavy feminist and womanist presence, I came up empty. Such films are simply not being made nor have they been made for consumption in the U.S. or in actually any international film industry.

Yes, we have had some amazing series produced interestingly enough by streaming services such as Netflix on the international stage, most notably the Mexican cartel focused ""Queen of the South"". However a feature film? Ms. Adetiba has the honor of being the first to really attempt such an endeavor and have it come off so successfully with such nuance.

The actress who played the main character Ms. Sola Sobowale? What a treat! She was amazing in her role! I understand that many here have derided the ""wailing"", unfortunately all of whom are seemingly Nigerians who perhaps are more so insecure about their own culture being ""exposed' however I was not put off by it in anyway and neither were the other Americans who watched the film with me. We called it damned good acting in fact.

As someone who quotes scenes from films such as ""Scarface""--a film in which one could also deride Al Pacino's performance as Tony Montana as being over the top and verging on histrionic, such emotional excesses instead become appropriate to the film genre and the individual characters who of course did not reach the top of a shadow economy by being conservative and reserved wallflowers. They're flashy like their materialistic excesses and dark crimes...and that's why such characters work, taking over our minds long after the film has ended becoming icons within our brains.

One should not be ashamed of the cultural nuances of this film anymore someone Italian should be ashamed of the cultural nuances put on display by Francis Ford Coppola in the Godfather. It becomes a part of the charm and Ms. Adetiba knows just how to display such with subtlety and reserved nuance.

The character is bold and over the top as she should be, but Ms. Adetiba knows how to operate with directorial constraint. Kudos!

Let me wrap it up by saying that I as a born in America, reared by Americans, non-Nigerian very educated individual who maintains an international fluidity in my experiences and perspective LOVED this film. Thank you Ms.Adetiba for giving the world an amazing female iconic character. Thank Ms. Sobowale for bringing an effervescent and believable life to the character that solidified this film as one of my favorites. To paraphrase the line of one of our most iconic cult characters in African American culture-----""Alhaji, she's a bad muth--shut yo' mouth!""

I will recommend it highly to all whom I know.

Quite interesting Well Its about a Chicago gang star and one ex army general in Nigeria in the reverse. But all that is now gone as we know more.,10,
"Salute to Kemi Adetiba and everyone who worked on this great movie.
This is by far the best movie to come out of Naija in a long time, the storyline, yes, especially the storyline, it is the bomb. These days, most naija movies just flaunt fine bodies, expensive houses n cars, cash, I guess to make up for the lack of depth or not so easy to follow stories, you just watch n make excuses n shrug as you watch, we gat to support our own, but this king of boys, damn! It has everything, they gave us fine cars, houses, faces, skin, everything to make us feel good and we still got great acting n a superb story.. I just can't get over the story... Please everyone should watch it and tell others about it too, it will be a great way to encourage the great mind that this came out of to bring forth more so we will keep having sensible, meaningful, worldclass movies come out of naija.

❤❤❤👌👍👍👌👍👌👍❤❤❤",10,
"It's worth the while Coming from Nigeria,this the best have seen,keep it up",10,
"A wonderful film experience! Substantial storyline.

King Of Boys was not ""just another"" recent nollywood film with only great cinematic quality whereas lacking substance in the plot. The storyline had depth and highlighted the present ongoing issues in Nigeria, addressing the difficulties in trying to be ""honest"" in a society standing on the foundation of corruption and it exposed the ""dirty-games"" within Nigerian politics.

The actors took their time to display realistic emotions and the dialogue was realistic as well. The entire production quality of the movie was great!

The suspense would keep you on your toes, and the comic relief would make you chuckle. It is definitely worthwhile.",10,

Kemi Adetiba is a Brilliant Producer. King of Boys is a must watch. I love the drama and suspend. I even had to look up on line who wrote the script because I suspected the person was from the street and wow it was Kemi. Good work mama.",10,
"I'm blown...and still reeling from the story and production.
I had watched the trailer, but it was 1/20th what the movie was. I heard Aunty Kemi promoting the movie on radio, but I had no idea. Aunty Kemi has upped the game when it comes to stories and production. You see, this movie blends the 3 major languages in Nigeria (ah well 4, plus English) beautifully...It almost didn't feel like a movie anymore! I expected the story to deflate at some point, buy boy o boy...it was full up until the end. The cast did a brilliant job...the lead was on fire! Kai...a must watch!",10,

Chief Daddy is the type of movie you can watch over and over. The actors are fantastic, and the movie overall is a not-so-serious narration with valuable teachable moments. Sure there are a few plot holes that could have been handled better, but overall I would recommend.",10,

Had the opportunity of viewing this movie at the Oakland Film Festival and exceeded my expectation. It is very entertaining and kept my eyes glued to the screen. It has great humor.

spicybeachgirl15 February 2021
My top 5 Movies in Descending order 1. Lara and the Beats 2. The Devil Wears Prada 3. Meet Joe Black 4. Coming to America 5. Bridesmaids

I am from the states, and I'm a HUGE happily addicted Afrobeats fan. So the music for me, especially the perfect placements for the scenes, was the sweetess cherry on top of my absolute favorite movie. Oh my God where do I start. The opening shot making a HUGE statement without saying a word makes this movie something every African American should see. Loved this movie MUCH more than the movie about a ficticuous African country that doesn't exist. This was hands down 100 times better set in a beautiful city in an African country that is actually REAL. As real as the chemistry between Lara and Sal. Much appreciated the drool worthy eye candy BTW, yummy! This Nigerian Slum Dog, well in this case Billionaire, was robbed of all of it's glory, due to a heaping flavorless serving of heavily promoted Disney white rice trying to pass itself off as Jollof with food coloring. Lara and the Beats was the authenic soul nurturing plate of REAL Jollof with plantains, smiles, and love. Hopefully now it will become viral on the small screen, and get all of the accolates it deserves. A must see multiple times.",10,

I saw this film on the netflix main page in the UK and decided to watch the film. I thought it was a black American film at first but was surprised it was actually a Nigerian film.

The cinematography was incredible, the actors and actresses did a good job especially Seyi, Big Chi and Somkele, Vector surprisingly was good too. I thought the end was just ok even though it was a happy end with the uche jombo and Uncle Tunde, i felt it could have been stronger. I feel this film raised the bar for the Nigerian film industry and i feel it would surely attract an international audience and portray Nigeria in a different light where it isn't always poverty and 3rd world quantifications we see.

"Wow! Netflix finally picked up something good.

Out of Nigeria from writer/producer Genevieve Nnaji, comes this sweet little gem. In a recycled and regurgitated superhero and action/cgi animation morass that Hollywood has turned into, this is a much needed diversion. Are you tired of sequel after sequel and prequel (laughable word) after prequel? Are you tired of seeing the same boring plot lines hashed over and over and, oh yes, over again? Fear not, here comes LIONHEART to the rescue. Its title fits the story. Nnaji put her whole heart into making this a genuinely beautiful piece. I started watching and was actually waiting for the movie to drop the ball. It never did. It does have a minor bit of suspense on how the story will play out. It touches rather lightheartedly, with a touch of humor, on the corruption in politics and money in eastern Africa without throwing it in your face. It ends rather nicely with a ""possible maybe"" of something more after the credits roll. It shows people that you don't have to have a billion dollar budget with all the best FX and top dollar actors hectic paced movie (that mirrors most people's lives these day), but that you can have your light and breezy lazy afternoon stress free movie (this one being without any possible way it could even get close to PG-13), and really feel good during and after watching. I think the only reason this got a PG because they showed girls in swimsuits by a pool, and maybe, just because no one is going ro take a G movie serious. Unless you have the moral compass of the creator of Playboy and Penthouse, this is a good one to get into on a cold and wet Saturday afternoon, watching with the family and relaxing by the warm glow of a fireplace.",10,

"A New Chapter in Nollywood

I honestly don't understand those who gave this movie a low rating. I don't typically write movie reviews, but I felt compelled to rate this one because it appears that a whole bunch of viewers aren't pleased with how Genevieve Nnaji in her directing debut managed to sell her movie to Netflix (a Nigeria first) and open in Toronto film festival.

For starters this is a Nollywood movie like no other. The cinematography is great, the makeup and costumes are great, the sound is much better than the mainstream, the acting is good, the story, though simple, is typical of what goes on in Nigeria, without any typical nollywood caricaturistic exaggeration (the screaming, the loudness, the trying hard to be funny or dramatic, etc.), and the duration of 90 minutes is just right. This movie is a genuine, realistic, and subtle introduction of the Igbo community of Nigeria to the world.

Lionheart is not just a good movie that made a dent in a rusty and stagnant Nollywood industry, this is a new beginning from which the young upcoming Nigerian filmmakers and actors know it is possible to put Nigeria on the global map of film.

I'd give this movie an 8, but to counteract the unfair low ratings of the haters and to appreciate the boldness of Genevieve's debut as a director, I am giving this movie a well deserved 10.",10,

"NOLLYWOOD'S BEST DIDACTIC COMEDY

Lionheart is a creative gift, a joyous feet of cast ensemble, potent storyline and qualitative production. From the beautiful lead character, Genevieve Nnaji to Nkem Owoh, we feel the lives of people who maybe different from us,share a unifying tie. Our contemporary reality in Nigeria and around the world is portrayed with grace, emotions and style in this film.

Lionheart isn't driven by noise nor quick flash scenes of hysteria, rather it solidly maps our humanity and individual response to lose, betrayal, courage and greed. This is a film that everyone will easily connect with. It is an honest human story of family love and value, ethnicity, and the underrated power of women in our society.

The comedy is timely, the story is uniquely told. This is Nollywood's finest film. The beauty of art is when every relevant details of the lives of people strikes us with empathy, truth and joy. Lionheart will make you feel empathetic, it's comical scenes will suffuse you with joy and laughter, and the deeper messages subtly and overtly told will reveal the common truth on responsibility, family love, united efforts and the beauty of our diversity. Any art that seek attention is vain art and Lionheart dispels fleeting interest. It's an immersive tale like never seen before. Watch and attest. 100% original film.",10,
"Nollywood at its peak!!!!

This movie tells a story about culture, unity and family. So many themes that I can't finish mentioning. Genny's directing skills, acting skills and the cinematography, cast, crew.., everything was top notch. The presence of the old Nollywood legends, the comedic stance placed well and smartly, the values of togetherness in our family, the hardwork put in to build a family legacy, the unity in diversity and most importantly the rich Igbo culture etc. The dining room scene was exceptional.",10,
"Great Movie from Nollywood.

Lionheart wasn't just written for the sake of it. It portrayed so many things going on in Nigeria that it'll take one with in-depth and an open mind to see through the movie. The opening scene corrects the fact that dialogue is a better solution to solving problems other than chaos. The veterans showed why they are called veterans. Pete Edochie gave the movie the maturity it has. Nkem Owoh aka Osuofia relaxed the mood of the film. Onyeka Onwenu was spectacular in her role as mother and her spoken Igbo sounded like she's singing. Kanayo O Kanayo the supposed villain gave a great performance as well. Phyno's music at the end gave the movie a perfect ending. All the stereotypes of Nollywood were shattered in the movie and I love the fact that Lagos wasn't used as it created room to showcase other great States of Nigeria. Genevieve tactically did all these. She knew exactly what she wanted to achieve with the movie and I think she achieved it. The movie is just a reminder to Nigerians and the entire world that with investment in Nigerian entertainment industry,we can create a better content that doesn't necessarily loose the essence of what makes us Nigerians. The story might not be to intriguing for some but it sure sent out a loud but subtle message that there are so many potentials lying around in Nigeria. Should I even mention the made in Nigeria Innoson (IVM) Motors used in the movie? Genevieve was actually born to do this and she's doing it effortlessly.",10,
"Feel Good Movie. Beautifully Made

"A Brilliant Series From Nigeria!!!
I am so happy I came across this series. I enjoyed it thoroughly from the beginning to the end. I hope there will be a season two.

My family loves to watch Nigerian films, but I often find the production rather poor, and I was often put off by the obsession with Christianity and the tendency to demonize traditional Nigerian spirituality. But this series cast a fair balance. Yes, religion is a big part of Nigerians' life, but so too are many other things, and the creators of this series gave us a glimpse of the huge potential Nollywood holds because this series actually rivals many similar films coming out of Hollywood.

The writing and directing were on point, the actors were superb: the lead actor, Sola Sobowale, was unbelievable brilliant. I also love the costume. Another thing to mention is the many Nigerian proverbs shared throughout the episodes. I didn't know Nigerians have so many wise sayings. They gave the writing/drama a strong boost.",10,
"Absolutely sensational

This made me feel proud to be Nigerian. The acting, production and sheer expertise of this 7-part sequel left me giving a standing ovation. Nollywood really has come far. Storyline aside, the performances from each character were phenomenal and really captured my attention. I wish Oscars could be given for Eniola Salami actress and Toni Tones (young Eniola). I think I went through every emotion - I cried, I laughed, I gasped, I got goosebumps and I was in awe.

The storyline was brilliant and I didn't see IT coming!!!

My hat goes off to Kemi A for writing and directing this masterpiece. The fact that I could easily watch tbis again says a lot.",10,
"This Is The Best Political Series In Africa

Let me start by saying kudos to every new members that made this outstanding political series possible

I'm a solute everyone and I must also encourage the producers to keep up the good work we need more of this

This shows the concept of politics, details everything is all about interest and no one is anyone's enemy until they are enemies

This is more like House of cards series, these conspiracy analysis, the betrayal , the interest this is all what make politics not just in Nigeria but in every part of a democratic world

Esp to those talking about lack of plot.",10,
"Great movie

I cannot for the life of me understand the low reviews for such a remarkable film.

"Seminal Movie in Nigerian Cinematic History
Living in Bondage the film that marked the start of Nollywood. It is a story of love, betrayal, suffering and redemption. The motifs of God and Satan plays a central roll in this film. Andy, played by Kenneth Okonkwo, makes a faustian bargain early on in the film. And his material gains is mirrors by his psychological loss. This duality of the material realm mirror the duality of the spiritual realm as there is no rest for the wicked. I walked out of the theater strong in faith. And faith in Nigeria is what I have now.",10,

Yes, it's that good and educational.",10,
"Best movie in 2021 so far
Though I didn't really understand the yoruba parts but I really enjoyed the part I did understand, as a guy who belongs to the new generation this movie gives an enlightenment on what it looks like during the 80's, a period we never met, our parents described it for us but this movie showed it to us, the acting was also so engaging, I felt like I was a part of the movie, thank you so much and I wish for more of these movies.",10,
Compelling story,10,
"This was nice and long but worth it
IMo, I thought this thing was very well put together. I loved the way they used the flashbacks in court from the protagonist's perspective to unfold the truth , so there was no paraphrasing in the throes of recalling unreliable memories.

It just worked, I also loved that I got to experience through the film another culture and it was nice and sweet and all the ancillary characters added a lot to the story.

And I loved the antagonist how his huge ego got in the way of a functional life for him , really cool! It was all explained and well-thought out. Loved it!

Way to go Netflix, this deserves a lot praise.",10,

The movie address a topic that is very fundamental in Nigeria Education system. Good story line, interesting plot, fantastic acting. Well done Temi. You were believable.. Don't listen to woke critics. This movie is one of the best you will ever watch on topics bothering on gender based violence in Africans higher institutions. Just enjoy it and firm your unbiased review! It's a cool one",10,

Best movie of the year 💕💕💕I wish it didn't end.",10,
"Love it!!!

Every movie from Kunle Afolayan is always a story we can all generally relate with. The storyline, natural acting , great casting is always something to watch out for. Citation has got a good story line with it's plots and twists describing natural causes in our lives. I would say, this is another amazing movie to watch.",10,

Citation is a must watch for everyone, it embodies a part of the rich African culture, an amazing love story, overall the movie is fantastic.",10,
"Excellent delivery

The movie is a wonderful delivery of the sexual assaults on university female student by some lecturer. It passes the message in a simple unsuspecting manner. Unpredictable end however, a few forgivable misses",10,
"Absolutely Splendid diving into a decade long issue of harassment by Lecturers
Please more of this meaningful content. Not movies focused on Lekki and oil money lifestyles. Yes some things might have been better but it gets a 10 from me because this is the type of content i love to see come out of nollywood.

Big respect to you Kunle.",10,
"Excellent storyline

Forget the critics, this is perhaps the best African movies this year. It has the best plotting and acting and to top it all, the best storyline.",10,
"Brilliant

Good story line that requires so much attention. But overall, the movie is well done.",10,

Thanks for this. I am impressed with it. But I Nelson Orah played the character of Ahmed, not Umar. I will appreciate it if it is corrected.",10,
"Heartfelt and raw - Must watch

Such a wonderful movie! From beginning to end it has you laughing, smiling, and crying. It really goes to show God's love and power even in our darkest and ""Last Days."" Many kudos to the cast (and producers) for a heart tugging film, their pain, suffering, love and triumphs were heartfelt throughout",10,

The plot twist was everything. Suspense filled. Gripping and interesting. Touched a lot on the importance of communication in relationships. I'll watch it over and over again.",10,

This is a much watch movie , absolutely draws you in ,in this true story , please please watch this as you won't be disappointed",10,
"This film is absolutely brilliant!

I'm going to keep this short... This film was excruciatingly painful to watch but it's portrayed brilliantly by everyone involved. This is a true story, much like the short film, ""Black Sheep,"" also based on the same premise, and again, is a true story. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje done a phenomenal job crafting this harrowing, despicable masterpiece",10,
"Romper Stomper with a twist and also a masterpiece drama

Best Skinhead Cultural movie done in years...if you like movies like Romper Stomper, This is England, A Clockwork Orange...you will probably like this and if you like well made dramas also.... actors first movie produce and from peronal experience too....exellent work mate....loved it...so sad that people down grade this masterpiece in art form from a personal view, from a rookie of making movies... enjoy folks....",10,

Totally underrated.

It's very well directed, and very emotional.

Amazing film takes you on a roller coaster ride Damson is an amazing actor and smashes this role ......Well Done Ade 👊🏽 110%",10,
"Don't listen to this negative feedback

Ive noticed some people can't handle the truth so they have to make up lies this is a great film not everything is true in the film but Adewale has said that but the old Tilbury skins are just jealous .... Take the film for what it is and understand life was bad in the 70s 80s for a lot of people enjoy the film and don't listen to this bad criticism.",10,
"GREAT MOVIE: The very best this year 2020.

The characters were real and brutally compelling. The idea that the skin head gang weren't portrayed in true light is flawed and in no way detracts from how good this movie really is. Dramatization as a function of theater was a bit exaggerated or twisted to buttress the rawness of the story and that's excusable. Plus Genevieve Nnaji and Gugu were fun to watch. This movie deserves an Oscar.",10,
"So relatable for Africans in the diaspora

Spoke to my own experience if being a African not living in Africa and trying so desperately to find belonging in a new home. Fantastic film!",10,
"Wow, this true story! Wow! Amazing!

Wow this story! The many many many stories of the Black experience throughout the African diaspora, and throughout generations. I am so glad our Brotha shared his story and got to write, direct, star in. And Damson wow, his acting is always amazing.

Stories that need to be told. Our stories. Stories that people wouldn't even believe if they were told. Amazing work.",10,
"People will never learn if they don't even try.

All the reviews here that are negative are simply negative because you are finding reasons not to like the movie. This movie tackles so many issues including the biggest one of all. Identity Crisis in Black men. If you're using the skinheads as an excuse not to like the movie then I'm sorry but you my friend are ignorant. There are hundreds maybe even thousands of movies where the black pimp or the black guy story is never told. No one complained about these movies and some of them are the best movies of today. To like this movie you mustn't be ignorant and blinded by such things. Because you wouldn't complain if this was a story of yours. This is a huge issue and a beautiful story that people should be open to hearing",10,

I worked on this film. I don't normally watch films I've worked on but this was amazing top man ade John",10,
"Story line on point

Really love the drama, suspense and how the Nigerian culture was portrayed. It flowed really good. Genevieve Nnaji was really spectacular. The court proceedings was very realistic. Not sure why the previous reviewer gave it a 6star. Must have had a bad day. Really enjoyed every bit. Good job team.",10,
"Beautiful movie depicting historic events in Benin kingdom

This movie was very educational and interesting to watch. I am still in shock it was done in 2014. The acting and directing was superb. Some reviews that heavily criticised this work seem racist and angry the white men were portrayed as wicked people.

Kudos to the cast and crew.",10,
"Well the movie is bad, but...

Well the movie is bad, but the story kept me watching until the end, which a I cannot say for a lot of new big production movies. Acting is bad, the production is bad, but despite of its floss I like it. It's 2 hours of my life which I did not regret spending.",10,

"Better than Bollywood!

I don't know on what basis people have given this movie such a low rating but believe me after a long time I've a watched such a good, cute, clean and better than Bollywood movie. Good job Nollywood. Keep it up. It gets 10/10 from me.",10,
"Heartwarming, good natured film

Appreciated the message about the universality of love and the way the film goes on to show the value of the protagonist in a professional, moral capacity as well as a her beauty. There were funny characters, and overall it was a feel-good, uplifting film. It would benefit from more screen time of the central couple but this was to flesh out the side plot and give time to the other family dynamics, so overall not a bad shift in the balance.",10,
"More than the synopsis

My first Nigerian Drama, this drama is more than a different race movie. The movie also dealt with the abuse that women face even though it was suppose to be a side note. The message came out clear and concise. Absolutely loved this drama.",10,
"GOD is calling...

Thank you for a perfect example of how HE works in our lives: This movie is a gut-wrencher, reminding us how He works through imperfect, repentant people who are only called to obey Him. He does the rest. He is faithful to complete what He has started. What a GOD honoring movie, showing the Triune in goodness and glory and power. Thank you.",10,
"Very uplifting

I knew about this movie in 2018 but didn't watch it. I somehow stumbled upon it few days ago from 22 Dec, 2020 and started glued to it. It was a 2hours movie that I rather shouldn't call entertainment but a moment of empowerment. If I was having doubts, my conviction got better... I was able to connect with the movie because obviously, I have experienced a touch of God before.

I say ""yes"" again to God's call.",10,

This movie gave me goose bumps I connected in a way that literally tore my soul. Indeed depicted God the way and manner it should God bless the writer, producers and all involved. The actors too are top top everyone did a fantastic job.",10,

My husband chose this movie end I didn't want to watch it. But I became totally sucked in and couldn't leave the room. The story of Sade is sad, but all that she goes through brings healing to her broken heart and changes her life in a meaningful and positive way. My husband and I both loved this movie!",10,

The movie has a lot of moral lessons. Great role interpretation by Zainab Balogun. If you have lost your way, this movie all you need to re-direct your path to God.",10,
"Saw the Premiere in Houston Texas

This movie should win an Oscar Award. The Storyline is so good. The Actors were all incredible, Vivica Fox, Kim B, Mickey R, and the Nigerians were just so excellent.

Seeing the effect of Oil pollution, and the poverty in the Oil producing regions, The corruption of Government officials, the huge influence the Oil majors have on the politicians, all of these were an eye opener, that the movie have so cleverly managed to bring to life, whilst keeping the entertainment value, it is short of a documentary. Really really engaging and educative.

It reminds one of 'Blood Diamond', I hope the world will receive it well, and it will help bring an end to the disaster as it currently stands, for the poor people of the Niger Delta.",10,
"THE BEST MOVIE. EVER.

Things Fall Apart is the BEST movie ever. Even better than The Force Awakens. It should have won at least 5 Oscars. Okonkwo is the sexiest man I've ever seen, and everyone I've met who have seen him desire him.",10,

"Maybe the best movie to come out of Africa in a good while!

I cannot believe no one i know hasn't watched this, it should be considered the Citizen Cane of African movies! You see Baby Police is GROUND breaking for it's time being, it's almost REVOLUTIONARY not only in terms of filmography but in terms of poetry, music, video games and humanity ITSELF! The story is based on a baby, that might in fact be one of the smartest babies alive, in fact i enjoy comparing this movie to Baby Geniuses by Bob Clark, of course this is a unfair comparison... Baby Police wins obviously by a MILE! Dada is so smart he can outsmart the entire village he habitats! He's enjoys playing pranks on inferior people than him and he knows how to survive in the cruel world of Africa by stealing TVs and tricking several other people all to survive the African Mecha Wars. A Truly beautiful struggle if i say myself, there where scenes of him that brang me to tears of how strong a baby can be! In fact this movie should be shown to all the babies considering i believe it would increase the brain size of a human TEN FOLD, thus making the human race evolve more and MORE! As the title says, he does become a Police in the last minutes (this shouldn't be a spoiler due to the fact that the title already gives away the entire plot) and later on has to do Police stuff due to a punishment, this struggle of him and the police also brang me to tears because he couldn't smoke weed while in front of the police force and that really is something PRETTY worrying! The dialog in this movie is as good as filmography gets, they are so emotional and symbolic and in my opinion this movie may be the most quotable movie of all times. Phrases such as ""You are the No."" and ""God Speed, Bring the Weed."" are always to be kept in my heart for it has helped me confront my fears in life. 

For me Baby Police was like being a starving baby in Africa later to be feed the most delicious and tummy-fulling dish of all the planet cooked by Gordon Ramsay! Needles to say, it didn't also save me from dying but it made happy with the most delicious thing i ever ate. I totally recommend this movie for people who grandma's are dying and have a sense of culture in there hearts.",10,
"Painstakingly conceived and teeming with raw, unbridled energy, Eyimofe offers a sumptuous, keen-eyed look at modern Lagosian life.",10,
"Excellent Realistic Drama

The story excellently showcase Nigerians realities. Message worthy of the efforts put into it. Excellent casting! & you will surely love the ending.",10,
"Powerful and deeply human film

""Eyimofe"" focuses on the hopes, desires and struggles of ordinary Lagosians, forced to daily confront a bleak world ruled by money and largely desensitized to human suffering.

It depicts the lives and problems of its main characters, Mofe and Rosa, with gritty realism and in a very engrossing way, with some unexpected plot twists and without a moment of boredom. The stories of the two protagonists are brilliantly and poignantly interwoven. The movie also renders the atmosphere of Lagos so compellingly that one feels literally transported to the city.

Mofe's inner strength, integrity, quiet dignity and stoicism are profoundly moving, though he is seemingly a man like millions of others. And one can't help being enthralled by the proud Rosa's attempts to change her and her sister's life for the better.

All the characters in the film seem very authentic - and often as inscrutable as real-life humans. Many of the characters elude any attempts at a simplistic classification into good people and villains, though it is clear that the most powerful ones are also the most ruthless and the most callous.

To me, the most fascinating and admirable character - apart from Mofe - was the landlord Vincent. It is easy to misjudge him, but his humanity touched me on a very deep level. Thanks to characters like him the heart-warming possibility of hope and solidarity always remains present in this film. This is a very beautiful and thought-provoking movie which I can highly recommend to everyone.",10,

"Good African Soap Opera. Two Thumbs Up

14 May 2020: Last year 2019, I started watching movies and television shows made in Africa, mainly Nigeria and Kenya. I would like to see the ""Fifty"" soap opera run for many years like American soap opera dramas. I like every episode.

Since I was born and lived in USA my entire life watching American movies and t.v show, I am Not use to seeing an All African (black) cast in soap opera dramas, but it is a real nice change of pace and the African actors/actresses are just as talented as their counterparts in North America. I really enjoyed watching pretty and talented African actresses Dakore Agbuson, Adesua Etomi and the so beautiful and talented, Pearl Thusi and the male actors are good too, Chris Attoh and other. Go Nollywood go.",10,
"Thrilling to watch!

If you are Nigerian, then you will understand that this movie is not a cliché, the plot twist was fantastic.

Well done to the actors, a great job, indeed!",10,

"A Major Step in taking back our narrative

This movie, has really showed a deep side of the struggles of the people we often ignore. Easy to see a person to judge, but when stories like these are told you start to look at everyone with a different lens. The ending, though abrupt keeps you in a limbo and holds you in a powerful suspense pondering on what you just witnessed.

A win for Mo Abudu and Director, Gyang",10,

This is my 3rd Nollywood movie and I am shocked. Really true, disturbing, unsettling. Some people are writting comments about the ending the cinematography etc, what did you expect? These real life subjects do not have a happy ending and no script. If you wish to see something easy and comforting you should look somewhere else.....",10,

"A Modern Nigerian Classic⚡

I am not Nigerian this lifetime, but I felt empowered by this INCREDIBLE 'Tour de force' eruption, if u will, of the nefarious exposure of British colonialism, pedophile plagued Roman Catholic Church, insane various tribal prejudices exposed galore & a truly decent Muslim Nigerian from the north detective tasked to quickly make sense of several horrible rapes & murders of tribal virgins in a southern small town - that began 6 weeks before October 1st, 1960 - the day of Nigeria's independence from the British.

Nollywood truly has a political/religious/tribal gem here for those who seek to broaden their perceptions of the whys of the major ills of the world & in this case a small community in Nigeria - r so pervasive today.

Soul comes to this physical reality for experiences & this film delivers a ton of them❤",10,

"A must watch for younger Nigerians and general lovers of a good film.
olawal-894-63752326 December 2016
After having this in My List on Netflix for probably a year, I finally decided to watch it, being a skeptic of all films made in Nigerian. I hate Nollywood and their repetitive nonsense films about love, in laws and general foolishness about money. And don't get me started with the bad camera work and sound/sound effects. Enter October 1st, the films is simply everything I wanted plus more. A good detective film, a love story without too much emphasis on the love, a country's last journey through independence from the white man and the very good play on the stereotype of the different tribes that makes up the Fedral Republic of Nigeria. I spent the first 10 years of my life there and still have and love the vivid memory's however often forget, lest I am reminded by films like this. Culture, language, food, palm wine and of course the British. The film was well acted, very well directed, you knew who the perpetrator is from the get go, but due to everything that made up the rest of the film, I didn't care that it took a while to get to him. It also had plenty of Yoruba spoken in it which is my first language, so this is one I will be recommending to all my fellow Nigerians. I will be looking out for more work by Kunle Afolayan. Well done!!!",10,
"Captivating and compelling!

Compelling and captivating! Beautiful colors and powerful performances. Camera angles invite you into every scene till the very end. Bravo for first shot!",10,

"Seminal Movie in Nigerian Cinematic History

Living in Bondage the film that marked the start of Nollywood. It is a story of love, betrayal, suffering and redemption. The motifs of God and Satan plays a central roll in this film. Andy, played by Kenneth Okonkwo, makes a faustian bargain early on in the film. And his material gains is mirrors by his psychological loss. This duality of the material realm mirror the duality of the spiritual realm as there is no rest for the wicked. I walked out of the theater strong in faith. And faith in Nigeria is what I have now.",10,
"Really Good Movie
This is probably the best Nigerian movie I've ever seen. Definitely a class above your usual light Nollywood stuff. Characters and plot were well developed and realistic. Noah and Dominic were really great in their acting.

And the movie props! I am sooo impressed! The ancient vehicles (404), appropriate hairstyles and attire and house decor. The producers and directors did their homework. It took me down memory lane. The movie was intense throughout, I couldn't even pause until the movie ended! Bravo!

At last a Nigerian movie that keeps viewers at the edge of their seats and was not predictable. Well done to those behind the effort.",10,
"Absolutely love it!

I'm usually not psyched about watching Nollywood films but this is definetly one of those you just can't afford to miss especially if you love love.

Well done to everyone involved in the film making process. I was really impressed.",10,

"One of Nollywood's Best Movies Thus Far

As a half-Nigerian, I'd grown up with Nollywood movies, and majority of them, with an exception to one alien-themed budget film, were terrible. From the previous decade, Nollywood movies, at least those I saw on local channels and ""Africa Magic"", are of three varieties: Wrath and fall of backstabbers... with a bit of Missionary help by the climaxes, village-themed, and comedic movies featuring the same two dwarf actors... which includes Osita Iheme. As you might realize, due to the same Nollywood formulas over and over, I really got sick of watching Nigerian movies altogether.

But then, ""October 1"", and this movie, ""93 Days"", along with trailers for older movies, surprised me, and didn't. I was surprised that Nollywood movies started to feel world-class, to the point of competing with foreign films. On the other hand, I wasn't surprised because I knew we could do it. It even showed on our music industries years back.

This movie was well-directed and written to the point that I started sympathizing with the Ebola victims being portrayed. The transition from scene to scene felt world-class and, plot-wise, well-connected and well-referenced. The acting were excellent, even typically West African, from the Liberian patient to the cab driver. I also liked the quick information, in the Washington D.C setting, that Lagos being a major travel hub could put many countries at risk with Ebola.

And, unlike the typical Nollywood classics I dreaded so much, which ended in the climax, and offering no resolutions, ""93 Days"" has a really good resolution. I won't spoil it for anyone, since it's a new movie, but I can say that you must not miss this film. Even get it on Blu-ray or DVD if you must. (Also don't miss the extra scenes, and the photos of the real people the movie portray, in the credits.)",10,
"New Pandemic that could happen again!

It's a a brilliant movie and very realistic about what really happened. It's better than the movie Contagion in my book. It really hit close to home for me.

"Fantastic Series from Nigeria

I love love this series. Great scenery. Fantastic acting. Everybody was giving their A game. The jokes were natural and very relatable. It was educative as well. That case of the widow fighting her in laws was relatable and I honestly never knew the legal system in Nigeria could support her. Dakore was all woman - beautiful, fierce, smart and sexy, RMD grey foxiness was a perfect foil. Nneka oh Nneka. You lighten up my day anytime with her fiersomeness. I loved all her cares. And ode to Malik. Still waters run deep eh. Please what the heck happened to the bribery video??? Episode ended with my mouth agape. Well played Judge. Kwabena - our own playboy. Denola - got the part of the confused spoiled son to a tee. Finally redeemed himself in the last episodes.

I didnt agree with all the unorthodox hiring and firing and casual assault. but again, very relatable. Can't wait for Season 2.",10,
"Bingeworthy

Castle & Castle is a well written dramatic Nollywood series. The characters are multi-dimensional and realistic. As an American, I most enjoyed seeing the legal system in action against the backdrop of the uniqueness of Lagos. Each case offers a glimpse at the diversity within Nigerian culture. Every episode left me wanting to see MORE. I can't wait for Season 2. I am definitely a fan. Thank you, Netflix for making Castle & Castle available to us in the West.",10,

"Please let there be a Season 3
I truly enjoyed the accidental find! I wish I could purchase a poster from the opening title.

All of the actors were very good. I enjoyed how the show was able to explain the cultural themes without making it heavy. There is also a bit of levity that does not undermine the fact that the show is about a law firm.

It is well worth the Bing watch. Sadly it leaves Netflix 14 Dec 2021.

I truly, truly enjoy that the show portrays black Nigerian professionals at there best. Something sadly missing from American television.

I'd enjoy a season three.

It has everything. Binge watched the entire season. Brilliant cast and has useful legal information for their target audience. Educational, suspense filled, funny and relatable characters. What more can you ask for? It literally ticks al the boxes.",10,

A film which captured a nation's hope for better cinema
luke_corradine23 January 2013
Warning: Spoilers
Its been almost a year since this film came out and an unbiased review is certainly easier to attempt now than ever before. Whoever watches this now or in the future have to understand that the film premiered a mere week after the Dana Air disaster which saw a Douglas MD-83 plunge into Lagos killing 150. Naturally the film was bound to face severe scrutiny in its homeland. A lot of those ""vibe""s have settled and the film remains a landmark and one of a kind on its own right.

As of 2013, Nigeria is mostly producing films which are deeply rooted in a homemade video culture which is hard to grasp by the westerner. Although I personally believe this country, under the right political vision, can be made into a gold mine for film, it is more than realistic to say that all that we have, for now, is a very productive although sub-par industry which most of the times calls films, what are in fact just video productions. 

In this climate, Last Flight to Abuja stands out for its quality, film-like screen presence and ambitious non-linear narrative as well as brilliant cinematography. It is also fair to say that Omotola, Kae-Kazim and Monjaro in particular, pull out some larger-than-life performances. I might as well add that these are actors who in all fairness, belong to a better industry, and its only a shame we don't get to see them at all in bigger productions. 

Last Flight also boasts great camera work which truly sets it on a league of its own. I believe the producers truly took quality to the forefront by shipping two Arri Alexa from Los Angeles for the shoot. The script which sits at the core of the film, was considered for a BAFTA nomination, and although it failed to realise the part in the end, it nevertheless stands as tribute to the quality which was put into this production and how this was appreciated beyond Nigeria.

The film was shot in a mere 14 days which is next to nothing for a story of this scale. This certainly stops the film from building into a true epic size, which perhaps would have been needed taking into account the subject matter. Still to this day, its casualty-free ending (only affected by the loss of the film's one villain) , is going to leave more than one unsatisfied. Although with foresight, there's not knowing if a bloodier end would have ever seen the film out. Considering how close the release was to the Dana Air disaster, that would have certainly been too much an impact for anyone to watch.

My last word is for director Obi Emelonye, who grabbed, with this film, a phenomenal success, beating The Dark Knight Rises and other blockbusters, in most theatres in Nigeria and Ghana. It is difficult to put a mark on Obi's cinematic impact in his country and beyond. We will have to wait another few years for that and see how Nigeria's film industry grows from this experience. Let me underline here that Obi's true legacy is not only that of his film's artistic value but also that of having restored confidence of Nigerian audiences in their own films. 

One can only wish that other Nigerian filmmakers will build on this same ground for a much brighter Nigerian film future.",10,
"Authentic!

This movie had so many parts that were real!

People do borrow clothes and cars and pose with them, lie through their teeth to drum up business and people do learn from their mistakes and extend a helping hand.

It was a great comedy with some good lessons including- don't believe the glitter!",10,
"Refreshingly good movie

I enjoyed the layers in the plot of the movie and the honest critique of Africa's wealthy politicians & affluent families.",10,
"Crazy,Lovely,Cool

My favorite Nigerian actress Adesua Etomi-wellington brought me to this tv series and I was not disappointed, it was a pleasant surprise to see good acting, really good writing on top of seeing her, all main characters had substance and were not over the top cliché characters, each episode could stand on it's own with plot twists and reveals, if anybody is looking for a good binge watch you couldn't go wrong with this Nigerian gem",10,
"An Absolute fantastic storyline

This show is not it all what I thought it was going to be. It is 10 times better. The different issues by each of the students and how they collectively group together to work them out, excellent and very positive. I am hoping for a season two",10,
"where is season 2

I just watched season 1 and I really enjoyed it. Please do a season 2",10,
"excellent coming of age story.

I loved loved this show. I binged it and HOPE there is another season. I work in higher ed and the students depicted are true to form Great combination of comedy and drama. Wisdom made me laugh so hard. He was excellent. the blend of the story lines were great.",10,
"A perfect story!

Amazingly realistic. It depicts the life and story of young Nigerian men living in Lagos.",10,
"Amazing

The storyline is quiet interesting, the actors are amazing and it wasn't as predictable as I thought it would.. Picture quality is awesome, Molly wood has really grown.",10,
"This movie will englighten you

As a Nigerian I know we have three major tribes: Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba. However, you don't hear the mention of Hausa in places like America. This is so sad because the Hausa tribe is the largest tribe in land mass and population in Nigeria. It's as if apart from the presidency, they have nothing left to offer, like they are meaningless to the country. Hausa's are termed the poorest-illiterates in the country. You hardly see or hear them in entertainment so the world isn't aware they even exist. This movie just resurfaced them, the music especially during the festival, was amazing I had to use Shazam, I wish they will make more movies like this. The Hausa tribe needs to be heard!",10,
"the best Nigerian Movie in decades

Honestly, this movie brought back great memories and gave me deep thoughts. This is the best movie out of Nigeria in more than a decade. This compares to old Nigerian movie classics. Kudos to Banky W, this man is pure class. I do not watch Nigerian movies because of the ""garbage"" most churn out, but this move right here deserves an Oscar.

Absolute 10/10",10,
"Let me quickly drop my thoughts

This movie relates to the current situation of most Nigerian youths, it doesn't matter how you make your money Just be successful that's all. Nice delivery from Gabriel, definitely one of our best actors! #Mustwatch for all Nollywood fans",10,
"my number one nigeria sci fi best movie
I love the movie, it falls into my favorite type which i am satisfy off, looking forward for nigeria to bring more to screen.

And my advice for us Nigerian is to support this movie to encourage them to bring and produce more better movies of our choice for us to watch.",10,
"Better than days of our live

Well written, acted, directed. Awesome soap opera about big boys in Nigeria. This is among my favorite series or productions out of Nigeria. Well done and enjoy!",10,
"A Must See - Sons of the Caliphate

I watched Season 1 and 2 on Netflix in the USA. This TV series is excellent. It has everything a viewer could want from Suspense to Romance to Action. Love the actors, script, storyline, culture and location. The characters all have strong, multi-dimensional personalities regardless of gender. I'm hooked on this show and am looking for Season 3 which has not posted to Netflix yet. Hopefully I can find it elsewhere. If you are a Black Panther movie fan, you will probably enjoy this series as well. It is filled with villians and good guys, unexpected twists and ah hah moments. Would highly recommend.",10,
"This show should have 5 seasons!!!!

This show was so interesting and entertaining. If the real Caliphate has a problem with it. Change or abbreviate the name, abeg. Great cast!!! Great writing!!! Great visuals. :)",10,
"Captivating

Zainab was captivating in her role as Sylvia. It left me hoping for a sequel. Throughout the twist and turns of the movie I could not help but be glued to the tv. I found myself pulling for Sylvia. Her seductiveness and witty demeanor was only surpassed by her outstanding acting skills.",10,
"Awesome

The first time I saw this movie I was blown away. I don't want to sound crazy but I try to study things of this world. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it, especially if they are truly into deities like I am. I hope to see a second installment with the same characters and a darker plot.",10,
"My own understanding

The storyline is interesting and I loved everything about the movie 🔥🔥",10,
"Amazing movie

It was a wow movie, from the cast to the storyline.. it was flowing, it gave all the emotions high and low.. such a beautifully written movie. Worth every cent..",10,
"Entertaining Fashionable & Educational!!!

Loved It All! Awesome Actresses! Entertaining Fashionable & Educational!!! These writers and directors were so on point. I started watching this a while ago, but stopped within the 1st few mins. I completely forgot to go back. I'm soooo glad I backtracked. This series had me begging for more. I'm a major fan of these women and men now. More, Please!",10,
"One of the best in African drama series

The talent, top notch , such quality acting from those ladies, hands down perfect.and the script was informative and well executed.

Keep it up Nollywood you're on the right track.",10,
"Original

I am impressed. And I am rarely with 9ja movies/series. But am here at 1am watching this. It connects the dots. Kudos to the effort. Arese kudos. Dealing with money is a rarely discussed topic yet everyone blames income. This addresses expenses and management principles. At the heartbeat of it is transparency with self and those one can hold accountable.",10,
"excellent Performances~

Well done! The performances by the entire cast was good, especially the actress who plays the mother along with the male and female lead. Would definitely watch more stories like this. The only thing I disagree with is the title. Since she was not the true villian, black rose does not seem like an apt title.",10,
"Level Up!

Nollywood movies are getting up where we want it. I loved the acting, storyline & casting line-up of this movie. Its a good romcom in a Naija way!

Nice acting y' all. . .",10,
"Very inspirant
I appreciate the story and all the intrigue. Sometimes i found angry but the end is beautiful. We have to decide for our life, nobody will do it for us.

The bosses loves only our hand and brain to help them succeed. But they aneliate us if we don't take care.

I appreciate the dresses of the actor principal. She is beautifull with her braids - natural is better.",10,
"
This is the nollywood evolution

This is arguably my best Nigeria movie for year 2019. I cannot find any misplaced in this movie, perfectly executed, simple and so informative about our society n thought provoking on career part for our children",10,
"so cool

This was so chilled. this movie was fun and enjoyable from the start. I've found no flaws to it, maybe the introduction is a little corny, but thats just taste. this movie was light but meaningful. highly recommended!",10,
"A very good movie with a good lesson!

This is movie is about a coming of age comedy/drama about a young boy who wants to fix things with his hands rather sit behind a cubicle. In a broader sense, I think this is just celebrating how things are done in Africa, and how kids learn to be humble.

I was really supprise by the cinimatography, story, and acting. I used to watch a lot movies from Nigeria but soon realize that the quality sometimes just isn't there for me but this movie just reminded that I need to explore more.",10,
"A much needed mascarade

This is not just another naija silly film. It's still silly and Nigerian, but in a witty, essentially thought-provoking way. It's a statement. An indepth look into physical vs spiritual balance, which we're all seeking today. A fable with humble esthetics.",10,
"Nigerian New Wave!

Thoroughly enjoyed the film! It was authentic, honest, absurdist, comical & inquisitive in all right ways.

I truly feel like this film was tailor made for me. I'm just realizing that this is the first/only movie that's actually told from MY perspective. I'm the target audience for this film!

And I'm looking forward to Abba's next feature!",10,
"i enjoyed the movie, and its overall message, that was frankly superimposed at all times. but the movie had a positive and optimistic message, so i found story development and everything to be appropriate.",10,
"These people deserve a whole fucking lot of credit for this movie. The writing is eh. Performances are eh. But so, so hard, and they did it. You have to appreciate that. ",10,
Great movie. It's a good watch. it was thoughtful and not a lot of forceful acting. It was good,10,
It is a well directed and produced movie with a very sensitive theme. The story is well told and brought to life with an amazing cast.,10,
It almost accurately portrayed the abuses a lot female students face in Nigerian universities and west Africa at large,10,
"Excellent Film

We have become so accustomed to one way of directing/producing a film. I believe that a film has to be reviewed based on it's own merit, not some made up standard.

This was a great film. A very simple storyline that provides a glimpse into the past to two boys (with many unknowns).. then the twists and turns that surround their reunion as grown men.

I especially enjoyed that many vague points or events where many viewer made assumptions that were clarified at the end. That, in itself, was very creative. As well, we have a credible view into another culture.

Well done! So different from anything I've ever scene.",10,
"Terrific film!

I had the pleasure of seeing August the First at SXSW this week. Of the 20 plus films I've seen at the festival, this has been the best. I'm still emotional about it.

This is an intense, heartbreaking family drama with an excellent script and stellar acting performances. But there's nothing over-the-top or exaggerated. Tunde's graduation party becomes the scene of a reunion, unwanted by all but Tunde, with a father who had abandoned his family 10 years earlier, moved to Nigeria, and started a new family there.

I really got to know these characters. I was particularly impressed with Joy Merriweather as Tunde's mother Rhonda, drinking to try to alleviate her pain and resentment, and by Kerisse Hutchinson as Simisola, the daughter who can't forget. Oh, and by Sean Phillips as big brother Ade and Ian Alsup as the idealistic Tunde. Oh, and by Dennis Rubin Green as the father, and by everyone else as well.

I really hope this makes it to general release and DVD.",10,
"Great Tale

This is a premium movie anytime. Tells the tales of our society decay . So sad ! So true!",10,
"Beautiful, Captivating, Powerful, Raw

This movie captured the troubles faced by the average Gen Z Nigerian kid. It did not gloss over anything. It left you angry and annoyed at some places. It left you triggered which I think was the point. To force the viewer to live the reality of the characters. I'm happy this story got told.",10,

"Breathtakingly nice movie!

I was browsing Netflix one night trying to find a movie or TV show connected to London, as I haven't been there in quite a while and started to miss the streets and urban atmosphere. This came up during the search. At first I was a bit skeptical, as I wasn't exposed to Nigerian cinema before. However, by the end of the movie (brilliantly done by the way), I realised that I witnessed an audio-visual masterpiece. Highly recommend!",10,
"This story is no fiction. The doctor who saved her country (and probably the world) from a deadly outbreak of Ebola has died from it. This very moving movie retraces what happened in Lagos in July 2014 with force and simplicity. The actors are convincing, true... It's sad, obviously, but also enriching with hope.",10,
"This film is done at a slow, steady, believable pace. I was completely drawn into the story and connected with all the actors as if I knew them. It is a horrible story of an Ebola attack in Nigeria. I cried the whole way through the second half because it is just that devastating. I will never understand how anywhere on this planet could be lacking a full equipped hospital with air condition running water, and all the things an emergency - infectious disease facility should have in 2014 - including individual quarantine areas for the afflicted. I honestly believe those who did die might have been saved had there been more resources. It is a must watch because this film really puts things into perspective for those of us who love to complain here in the USA. Lastly, it is a story of courage, sticking together, support & love between human beings - friends strangers co-workers and family. It is all of this that makes this one incredible true story. I am so sorry this happened. I just wish I knew where this deadly virus came from.

",10,
This was an excellent movie. I would recommend it to anyone!,10,
"Very Touching, Very good, Very recommended",10,
Very great movie.....it stimulates thoughts. There shouldn't be racial discrimination.,10,

The story starts a bit slow but stick with it. Very good story.,10,
I love old movies like this,10,
"Beautiful movie depicting historic events in Benin kingdom

This movie was very educational and interesting to watch. I am still in shock it was done in 2014. The acting and directing was superb. Some reviews that heavily criticised this work seem racist and angry the white men were portrayed as wicked people.

Kudos to the cast and crew.",10,
"A must watch
Beautiful romance movie. I just decided to try it when saw it on Netflix and there was nothing to regret. The songs chosen were really good.",10,
"Amazing and Crazy Hilarious
This is the most hilarious movie I have come across this year. And it even uses something I have never seen in a movie before, the use of hilarious quotes. The acting, story, cinematography and directing are all on point. Super impressed.",10,
"Very Different!

This is not your everyday movie. The star actors really deserve awards for their roles. I loved every minute of it. Please watch!",10,
"Pleasant Surprise! Great Acting!!

Don't understand the low rating for this film at all. I happened upon this great movie by accident and I'm so glad I did. Usually when you see movies from Africa her in America is in the jungle and all of that stereotypical shows. But anyone with a pea size brain should realize that there is so much more to the motherland than what America wants us to see. Movies like this is one of them. It depicts Africans and Africans acting in films like any other movie with a great plot. Watch this and see another side of Africa that is sorely needed here in America. The storyline had me on edge and I could NOT figure out the ended. It was fantastic!!! You will not be disappointed. The have. Chris Attoch who is affectionally known as the The Denzel Washington in many places in Africa in the film and he's great even with a small role. Adeusa Etomi and Uzor Arukwe give stella performances as the films main characters.",10,
"Lovvveeeee

So relatable! Sad there is only one season. Stayed up til 2am watching this show!",10,
"Petition for a second season
❤❤❤❤❤ really loved this show i wish we can have a second season loved it😙😙😙",10,

Every single scene was fun to see. The plot was amazing, I never saw it coming that the Lady prostitute could do that 4 him. Watch it!",10,

The Delivery Boy is very refreshing, a beautiful story, told brilliantly. You should see it!",10,
"Great film and great action

Great story original great action and great comedy all combined in one. Thrilling film and great cast.",10,
"Loved everybit of this movie

I have seen this movie 5 times already. i really like the movie",10,
"Just stunning

Such a beautiful movie. Stunning scenes of Africa. A beautiful depiction of an accidental love story with believable characters looking for more in life i.e. Love, family and fulfillment of dreams. Makes you feel good all round.",10,
"Beautiful movie

Probably the first and only local movie I have watched end to end and more than once. Saw it first when it came out in 2012 and 3 years down the line, I seem to love it all the more. Found some faulty scenes though for instance, I thought the fact that Akin didn't realize he had someone else' phone (especially as he read a text message on it) was a bit out of place. I thought the phones were similar but not exactly the same - bold 9000 vs bold 9900). I also thought the end where Akin kept the luggage in the trunk himself while the driver stayed put in the car (that's not so usual) was also faulty.

But outside those few quirks here and there, it was an all round entertainer. Good job",10,
"Shows corruption in its splendor

An African drama. It deals with an irregular governor elections where in a district there are murders, which makes the commisssions annul in that place, that causes the candidate who lost to start a campaign where she proclaims herself the legitimate president and takes the case to court so that they can be do justice to electoral fraud. Does history sound familiar to you? I think things like that don't just happen in Mexico, it's global. Quality. Entertaining. Some actions are not fully achieved but it works. The torture and murder scenes are well managed. It explores corruption, electoral fraud, party influences, and mismanagement in the political sphere. The third act takes a turn that will leave you with a sour taste of the film.",10,
"This story was a beautiful picture of the balance of joy and sorrow during the time of the Nigerian Civil War. The actors paint vivid images of the realities of setbacks and victories in life set against the backdrop of a country in turmoil and seeking to grasp its own identity. I loved it and I would recommend it. If you are looking for something that will give you shallow stereotypical narratives of Africa, this is not the film. However, if you are seeking a film that will challenge your previous understandings and grow your compassion, this is DEFINITELY the film for you
",10,
"No words to describe the power of this movie and its reminder of how fortunate it is to have never lived through a civil war. Extraordinary story telling of tragic, recent Nigerian history and the humanity within it all.",10,
Fantastic lead acting. Left emotionally devastated. Story is powerful.,10,
This film is is a true story and is aposlutely brilliant and moving.,10,
"I  just watched this at The Newport Beach Film Festival, and this has got to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. The movie had a good pace with excellent writing & production. This movie is one of those movies that you can never forget. The cast was perfection. The chemistry between the two lead characters was undeniable. And the best part of this movie is that it is based on a true story. Watch it!!! Support GOOD movies.",10,
I have read the book and i thought that the film was brilliant with very strong performances by the main actors. One of the best films I have seen this year with old news footage interwoven with the main story,10,
"Great ending. This movie kept me interested until the end, which is not easy to find in movies these days. A little predictable but still has suspense.",10,
lol dis movie is funny ð???ð???ð???ð???ð???ð???ð???,10,
"Destiny Ekaragha's ""Gone Too Far"" is so London, so Naijia, so Jamaica, and just so hilarious to boot. It had me in stitches, laughing so hard until those stitches opened. Loved the movie's fast paced story-line, catchy sound tracks, brilliant cast, talented actors (especially Golda John as Mum), and the right on point dialogue such as: ""I want everyone to text immigration and say, give sunshine a stake in London."" ""But is he really African though? His parents are African, but is he African?"" ""What does an African look like?"" ""I don't know, an African innit."" ""A Yoruba accent is the sexist accent in the whole wide world. Ask anyone with sense."" ""You need to let them know you're an African, bruv... Let them know the Afs, we're here: big Afs, small Afs, round Afs, Japanese Afs. We are here! What an excellent movie, with Radio DJ running commentaries and tracks that make the movie reminiscent of Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"". Basically, ""Gone Too Far"" is a cultural studies keeper! Watched it thrice already, plus buying me a copy soon.",10,
fantastic movie,10,
"One of the greatest artistic pieces of all time

This film is undeniably one of the greatest movies of our generations. This film plays with the viewers emotions through its entirety and did a fantastic job mixing the different genres the film industry has to offer. Another way to describe this film is that it is a landmark in the industry and offers nothing but innovation. The future is nothing but bright for Nollywood with this films release",10,

Doctor Lanre is a well written movie, captures our different characters and kept me glued to my screen until the last minute. I great watch for everyone, young or old, married or single. I will be looking out for other reviews.",10,
"Doctor Lanre' is an Interesting Shift

I am glad to be one of the first on the train of this movie. This is an interesting shift. The story has a rich plot that is carried effortlessly by the superb performances of the cast. While the performances of the lead, Okey Uzoeshi and Bolaji Ogunmola are applaudable, it is Blessing Obasi that has stolen my heart.

This is a must-see.",10,
"Great Piece

This is a well crafted, mind blowing work. The fact that I couldn't guess or know how it was going to end, blew my mind. The suspense is top notch. No unnecessary clip to prolong the movie but straight to the point. This is changing the narrative of Nollywood movies. Cheers to the Writer and Director. Highly recommended.",10,
"Such wonderful writing

Doctor Lanre is a wonderful movie. Had so much fun watching this one. It captures the everyday life, demographic, region, it is diverse and a joy to watch.",10,
"One of the Best movie from Nigeria so far

A Better family is a movie that I'm very proud of when it comes to Nigerian Nollywood movies. This is a movie that you got to enjoy every bit of it from beginning to the end. It's strong lesson on relationship for both married and singles always blow me away. This movie is a must watch for both married and singles.",10,

Beautiful story that portrays Nigerian culture. The story is so unique and unpredictable unlike an average Nigerian movie. A must watch,10,
"Genevieve Nnaji stamps her foot concretely in the pantheon of genuis directors. She doesn't disappoint in her debut, Lion Heart. It's a must watch, as it announces the birth of an international Nollywood.",10,
I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Beautifully shot and delightfully funny.,10,
Lovely movie... a mix of everything,10,
"This movie is a beautiful representation of a modern life for a family faces with running a failing company in Nigeria, the camera play, acting and just overall environment of the movie exceeded its expectations. I have watched a million movies but Ive made one review, and this would be it. LOVED IT",10,
Lot of lessons within a simple simple movie. The story was very good and comforting.,10,
A rare story about the values of family from a very distinctive perspective. Eloquently interpreted with perfect casting,10,
Film showcases a dynamic look at Nigeria from the lenses of a progressive female protagonist navigating her way through a male dominated business culture. It keeps a light and fun energy at the same time and a compelling family oriented story line. The characters particularly the Uncle are funny and engaging. The characters feel well fleshed out and the quality of production is solid. I would recommend streaming ï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2~this Netflix original!,10,
"It was completely refreshing to watch from start to finish. An intresting deviation from the typical Nollywood movie. Veteran actors Pete Edochie and Nkem Owoh effortlessly show us why they are the best in Nollywood. Genevieve definitely sets a standard for local Nollywood movies with Lions Heart and as for her Directorial debut, someone give her an award!",10,
great cinematography. good editing. could do with a better story. writing was good also. overall good movie. great work by genevieve nnaji,10,

This movie was excellent. Nollywood stand up!!,10,
"Great movie, I really enjoyed how it criticised the wealthy and powerful's shortcomings instead of glorifying their existence.",10,
This is a must see movie. I was very impressed!!!,10,
"How does a movie with this subject matter wind up being this slow and boring? Where is the urgency? Where is the suspense and tension? The editing and the pacing drove me nuts and there's just no way this thing needed to be nearly two and half hours long. And that's really a shame because it highlights a really big and important problem, I just wish it did so without putting the audience to sleep.
",10,
This is my favourite Nigerian film. Really enthralling debut feature.,10,
"Really Good Movie
This is probably the best Nigerian movie I've ever seen. Definitely a class above your usual light Nollywood stuff. Characters and plot were well developed and realistic. Noah and Dominic were really great in their acting.

And the movie props! I am sooo impressed! The ancient vehicles (404), appropriate hairstyles and attire and house decor. The producers and directors did their homework. It took me down memory lane. The movie was intense throughout, I couldn't even pause until the movie ended! Bravo!

At last a Nigerian movie that keeps viewers at the edge of their seats and was not predictable. Well done to those behind the effort",10,
"MY FAVORITE ROMCOM, YOU BITCHES COULD NEVER!!! and i was rooting for the white man... what about it? i can hate em and love em at the same time, the duality of man. thank you",10,
This was my first Nigerian film and certainly won't be my last. Wow the outfits were amazing and sets everything was so colorful I loved it. I love how feminist this was. Isoken stood up for what she believed in and learned to not take shit from anyone her character development was so nice to see. Kevin and Isoken had such amazing chemistry. This was such a vibrant and fun film I really enjoyed it.,10,

The clothes given to Oba, Eniola Salami, for every single scene she appears in shows careful thought and a synergy between the cast and crew of this movie. It is the kind of synergy and excellence we have clamoured for in Nollywood. 
",10,
"The casting of KOB2 gives the most appropriate roles to the people who would leave all on the screen, and they give stellar performances, including those who had non-speaking roles and cameo appearances. The acting is on point, so much that even facial expressions spoke volumes. In particular, Eniola Salami, played by Sola Sobowale, used facial expressions in silence, saying nothing, yet speaking loudly, is an image of the quintessential Yoruba mother",10,
"The post script scene will have you laughing out of the cinema hall, and you will find yourself breaking out in a grin each time you recall flashes of the movie.",10,
"My Village People is a movie that will have you losing your home training while watching it. But it is a pathfinder of sorts. Nollywood generally has not done a good job of making the supernatural sexy and appealing. My Village People achieves it effortlessly, and deserves copious amount of praise.",10,
"This movie, My Village People, gives us a very interesting plot twist that has us laughing and giving an applause, and the conflict resolution is well done, in terms of the script and the acting.",10,
"My Village People delivered fantastic special effects, and they are not over the top. One of my favourite special effects is the rain. The technical crew deserves special recognition for their skills in this movie",10,
"Technically, the sound is very good, and camera angles and techniques are unusual and interesting. The fight scenes are well choreographed;  you see real action, and you feel a sense of satisfaction. The movie serves up a real action comedy, provides the right mix of laughter and action, as well as the right amount of danger. The few points of idiocy do not take away from the excellence of Mamba’s Diamond.",10,
"The comedy is of a wide spectrum; you laugh at the bumbling petty thieves, and you guffaw at how two men, standing over the body of the person they have just stabbed in the heart, calmly discuss being called to pastor! The same men get very upset when someone swears, and ask the person to say his last prayer while they bow their heads.

While one or two scenes could be better, they do not take away from the excellent script writing and dialogue. I do not understand why a law enforcement officer would be spilling the details of a case to a man she has rescued twice in the same day. I think it is unprofessional, but it needs to work into the script somehow. But mostly, actions are believable. ",10,
"From the pair of God-fearing cold-blooded killers who exchange sermons and dream of pastoring, two bumbling petty criminals, the always smiling female head of a crime empire, to a corrupt police officer on the payroll of the Mafia head, Mamba’s Diamond has it all. The movie starts with a suspenseful bang. It moves from South Africa to New York to Nigeria. This does not begin like your regular comedy. Within the first 15 minutes, 6 people have been killed in cold blood because of this diamond. The movie drags you to the edge of your seat and demands that you pay full attention. ",10,
"Breaded Life is a true Nigerian romantic comedy that will tug at your heartstrings, and you will want to see it again and again.  
",10,
"Every single character in the movie did an excellent job. This includes Biodun Stephen playing a cameo role. But Bimbo Ademoye and Timini Egbuson deserve the best accolades. Bimbo is such a versatile actor, it is a beautiful thing to watch. She embodies the character of the bread seller, who life keeps dealing a bad hand, yet she rolls with it and makes the best of it. Bimbo must have trained for months; you will believe she is an Egun woman. She also speaks the language, both of the street and of the character, beautifully.

Timini Egbuson has truly grown as an actor, and it is refreshing to see him able to follow the development of his character from a spoiled rich kid to a hard-working street hustler.  The chemistry they both display on the screen is a thing of beauty to see. 
",10,
"While every movie or work of art has its flaws, Breaded Life is almost perfect. A few of the scenes may have gone on a tad longer than necessary, but they do not detract from the overall enjoyment of the story. The locations are perfect for the movie, giving us such a rich viewing experience, moving us from the affluent neighbourhoods to the almost destitute areas where people have to work for daily wages. ",10,
"Breaded Life is the classic story of rich boy, poor girl romance, but with a plot twist that speaks of excellent and out-of-the-box thinking. It is the kind of feel-good story that leaves you grinning from ear to ear.  The rich boy finds himself at the mercy of the benevolence of the poor girl, who turns out to be his life-saver.

The story draws you in so much that you find a bit of yourself in all the characters. It weaves everyday character, everyday life, everyday comedy into a story of self discovery, paying penance for years of indulgent living, and concluding in a reveal that the director has been subtly hinting at, but which you are not able to touch till it is handed to you. You keep guessing, but when the reveal happens, it is so satisfying that you are happy for the suspense. ",10,
"If you are looking for a tight plot, excellent acting, unusual reveals, and situational comedy, with a touch of home-grown romance, this is the movie for you.  Breaded Life has the viewers laughing from the first scene and does not let up till the last scene, including the post script. This movie, which is a cocktail of laughter, emotions, with a strong vine of authentic romance holding it all together, is a sequel to an earlier one by the same director, Biodun Stephen. I am glad to see that it is a refreshing departure from how Nollywood does sequels. It was not a direct continuation of the previous story, but characters from there were seamlessly flowed into this. ",10,
"This movie feels like a mish mash of under-developed ideas with a half hearted romance thrown in. It is not sure if it wants to be a comedy or a satire. As slapstick comedy, it falls short of the expected full-on laughter and ridiculousness. As a satire, it does not have enough ingredients and irony to truly carry that flag. It is full of social media slangs, trending hashtags, and the worst of poverty cliches. ",10,
"The production quality of La Femme Anjola is very good. It is hard to believe it is not Rita Dominic singing directly, which speaks of very good directing and editing.",10,
"I enjoyed seeing very good parts of Lagos, both on the mainland and the island, used, unlike other movies that stay in one location. Lagos is a beautiful place to shoot a movie, especially if the diversity of the state is put to use, as seen here. Accident scenes are usually tricky for Nollywood to portray, but it was a pleasant surprise to see a very believable one here. ",10,
"La Femme Anjola is a well packaged Crime-thriller that deserves every award coming its way. I look forward to more beautiful storytelling like this. Movies of this overall outstanding quality may cost a bit more, but they are totally worth it. Nobody can tell our stories like us, and we need to tell them in ways that are unique to us. ",10,
"The quality of the script cannot be faulted. It shows a well researched storyline that flows naturally and has no stilted parts. You would keep wondering, thinking you had solved the crime, only for you to later realise the script is several steps ahead of you. The movie is two and half hours in length, but there is no dull moment.",10,
